Vi had heard that this was an excellent place for a fabulous meal. great meal? check. excellent venue? ummm ... i think i was initially just weirded out by their large fish aquarium up front. it cast a weird 1980s miami vice blue glow out into what could be transformed into a really upscale room. \u000a\u000athe lighting needs work. but the waitstaff is helpful. it's pretty expensive - they've got prices i'd justify if they could get the atmosphere right.
p8
aVService was excellent each time we've been there. Food is good but not $100+ good for a party of 2. We thought it  was overpriced for the quality of the food. The heavy cream was overdone in most dishes, typical of want-to-be French restaurants. Desserts were the best part of the meal, actually better prepared than the entrees and appetizers.
p9
aVThe thing about Nadias is that it DOES remind me of a restaurant that you'd find in the Quartier Latin or in St. Germain du Pres, where ambience is not in their top list, but top notch food is.\u000a\u000aAnd that's exactly what you'll get here.\u000a\u000aThe decor is pathetic.  Sorry, but they can afford to renovate the place.\u000a\u000aBut their food is delish, their staff is INCREDIBLY attentive, and for some stroke of luck, everytime I go there for my birthday, the owner's best friend also is there in the next table, he orders a full flourless chocolate cake for him and his wife, not eating it all, and sees me and remembers that it's also my birthday, and orders me a cake and champagne too.\u000a\u000aOk, that's neither here nor there, but it's pretty cool that that happens.\u000a\u000aNO, I WILL NOT tell you when my birthday is... Hmph.. . You think I'm gonna divulge my secret?!??!?!\u000a\u000a*(hmphy, I wonder if that's already in the yelp info about me... Damn it!)
p10
aVGrade: C-\u000a\u000aGood food. Lousy service. WAY OVERPRICED martinis @ $10 each. I thought the bat flying around the dining room was a nice touch. Skip this hole.
p11
aVAhh...Nadias...where to start...\u000a\u000aI'd love to write that I can overlook the grimy dining room and horrendous service because the food is so good.  The truth is that the food is decent if pricey but not nearly good enough to make up for Nadia's many other shortcomings.\u000a\u000aI know this is a strong statement but it was the worst service I've EVER had in a restaurant at this price range.  Yes, I mean that.    \u000a\u000aA quick list of 'to dos' for Nadias:\u000a\u000a1.  Hire a service for that fish tank.  Nothing is more gross than an algae -filled fish tank in a restaurant.  \u000a\u000a2.  Replace the missing ceiling tiles and clean the chandeliers.\u000a\u000a3.  Install a new rug.\u000a\u000a4.  What is the deal with the circa 1994 TVs in the dining room?  I felt like someone was flipping channels all evening. \u000a\u000a5. Sashimi Tuna @ $32 should not be served well.  And it was small.  \u000a\u000a6.  You should not run out of your Prix Fix Chocolate souffle at 7:30 PM on a Wednesday night.  Oh yea, and it shouldn't have the consistency of Jello pudding. \u000a\u000a7.  The alcohol prices are a bit high.  $7 for a local brew is not ok. \u000a\u000a8.  Figure out your french onion soup - it should be a staple.  Its WAY too sweet.  \u000a\u000aI'll stop here.  Nadias rests on their laurels and their State St location.  I can not recommend.  2 stars only because I think there is potential in some of their dishes.
p12
aVMy wife and I went there for a Valentine's day dinner....so my experience may not be typical of an average day. Anyways, here's my bit...\u000a\u000aWe had a reservation for 7.30. We were not seated until 9pm....by which time, I had lost my temper, appetite, and the mood for some over-priced, sub-par rack of lamb! The food was barely ok....the tables were too close to each other and we were seated pretty close to the kitchen with a darn pillar blocking most of my view. Guess the window tables might be fun...but I don't think I'll ever go back to find out.
p13
aVThis has always been our favorite restaurant for celebrations but we're going to have to rethink that.  This is now the 3rd time we have had either bad service or less-than-excellent food.  Nadias is not a cheap restaurant -- the two of us each had one cocktail, an appetizer and main course:  $110 before tip.  For that price I expect that my food will be top-notch and the service impeccable.  First our foie gras went to another table and sat there for quite a while before the waiter realized it had gone to the wrong table.  By the time it got to our table it was stone-cold.  We ended up sending it back to get heated back up.  Then, no soup spoon -- we had to ask for one.  Then my salad had the wrong dressing on it -- had to send that back.  On top of this we witnessed multiple f***-ups so bad that I over heard the owner/chef griping at the wait staff -- and later, the sous chef had to go to the wait staff area/garde manger kitchen to get them to pick up their dishes that had been sitting on the line.  Nadias used to have an edge but it seems to have dulled with time!
p14
aVOh no. Nadia's was supposed to be our special mother/daughter dinner when I came home for the Christmas holidays. I would call it less than special.\u000a\u000aUnfortunitly, we were the only diners throughout our entire meal. The place was e-m-p-t-y. They started to take down their holiday decorations while we were dining...which made it even more depressing. Can't that wait until you close?? \u000a\u000aWe ordered some nice wine by the glass, and bread and some sort of compound butter came to the table. Pretty good. We ordered a roasted veggie tartine, which was also okay, not great.  Now, for the main course.....\u000a\u000aI ordered the cassoulet - French restaurant, brutal winter weather outside, and the promise of duck confit...you would think this would we a wise choice...that is until it came to the table. I swear to god, it came out in almost a 9x13 baking dish it seemed...two pieces of duck confit, about three sausages, and some pork...all covered in a pile of white beans and breadcrumbs. Is this family style? All I could taste was the salty duck - I love duck confit, but this was overload. The beans turned in to a bean goop mass as soon as I used my fork.   I picked at it, and took the rest home in a to go box.  I don't even remember what my mom got.\u000a\u000aShucks.
p15
aVSo this is a sort of unusual Yelp review, given that we didn't actually end up eating at Nadia's. Here's why:\u000a\u000a1. The food was pricey. And I am a person who can be willing to spend on occasion, but for Madison, this place was a little too expensive for its location and food.\u000a2. The main reason we didn't eat there. There was nobody in the restaurant. I mean NOBODY. No host, no customers, nobody. And yes, it was open for business (according to the unlocked doors and times posted).\u000a3. The kitchen looked disgusting and the fish tank (as noted earlier) could definitely use a good bath. Ironic, yeah.\u000a\u000aWe strayed off to find some other food and settled for the close-by Porta Bella.

VI love, love, love this place.  It's been around for 10 years.  Just down the street from me and for some reason I just never got around to going.  Finally, in November my mom and I went for dinner.  Amazing!\u000a\u000aI'm a convert!  I'll be a Coup Des Tartes for special occasions and just for fun!  \u000a\u000aThe food was wonderful.  Recognizable with a twist.  Fresh ingredients and really nice service.  This little place has more character in its little pinky that so many other restaurants in the Valley.  From the pictures on the walls and photographs on the fireplace to the staff.  \u000a\u000aI took my boyfriend for a romantic date night the weekend before Christmas and it was great.  He said the same thing I'd been thinking, "WHY haven't we been coming here for years?"\u000a\u000aI think I thought that it was much more expensive than it was.  Mom and I had one app, one salad and two entrees for $80 (including tax and corkage) and BF and I had one app, one salad, two entrees, one dessert and two corking fees for $121 (including tax and corkage).  No bad folks.  Pretty darn good actually.  It's BYOB, so we had wine that would have cost us over $150 in a restaurant, but we brought it from home.  I love it!\u000a\u000aStandouts for me were the mushroom & Gruyere tarte, lovely and cheesy and flaky all at the same time.  The lox and potato appetizer was fabulous, and I'm not a big lox fan and I loved this.  The baby arugula salad with pears, feta and candied pecans was a perfect balance of flavors and textures.  The lamb entree is good and surprisingly, I tried the chicken cordon bleu and it was terrific!  Most amazing though, is the Grand Canyon dessert -- layers and layers of chocolate and peanut butter mousse.  Light and fluffy and rich and decadent!\u000a\u000aBon Appetit!
p21
aVFor fresh American faire with a French twist this homey little cottage with hardwood floors will tickle your fancy!  The owner is also the head Chef and the menu changes regularly.  Fresh salads featuring a little fruit and nuts is my favorite aperitif.  Seafood is usually featured, along with chicken, light cream sauces and nicely sized portions that a girl can actually finish.  This is a great place for a romantic dinner, or girls night out before the theatre, or intimate dinner with another couple.  I believe they now have a liquour license that allows for wine service and maybe more?!  A back room is available for larger groups, call ahead to reserve it.  Reservations recommended, in general.  Only open for dinner.  Moderate to upscale prices.
p22
aVmy boyfriend took me here on my birhtday after several strong suggestions from his coworkers for a nice, romantic option.\u000a\u000aand i was blown away! if you've been to house of tricks in tempe, expect the same crowd, decor/atmosphere and price, and the same food quality.\u000a\u000ait was a beautiful historic house with an outside deck. it was very tiny, and it gets a little loud with the small settting and hardwood floors, but not enough to ruin a meal by any means. we had reservations on a saturday, and still had to wait for about 10 minutes. during taht time we saw several groups come in without reservations and get turned away. \u000a\u000athe BYOB was a killer surprise. my BF printed the menu from their web site and took it to AJs and asked the wine guy for his suggestions, and that worked out perfectly.\u000a\u000ai have to suggest the brie brule, brie covered with caramelized apples and served warm with toasts and seasonal fruits. absolutely wonderful and melt in your mouth.\u000a\u000awe also had mozzerella and tomato salad, which was overkill on the cheese, but still good. i had the filet mignon and he had the pork tenderloin and they were also unbelievably good.\u000a\u000ai'm sure it was a hefty bill, but def worth it for special occasions. i will def go back!
p23
aVWe absolutely love this place... We visited here probably 7 times over our 3 years in Phoenix.\u000a\u000aEveryone seems to think this place is a French restaurant, and that is incorrect.  This place serves modern american food with deep roots/influence in French Bistro food.\u000a\u000aHighlights:\u000a\u000aFood -- We've eaten pretty much the entire gamut of the menu.  Favorites include the Pate de Campagne, Baked Feta and apples, all of the salads, pork loin, filet, chicken, lamb with couscous, and the desserts.   MMMMMMMM the desserts.  The lemon tarte and the Grand Canyon (haven't seen that on the menu in a while) are devine.\u000a\u000aService-- Always have had great luck here.  The staff is very attentive and know when to check in and when to leave you alone.  \u000a\u000aBYOB -- Love this!  I hate having to purchase wines limited on whatever list the restaurant has.  The corkage fee is very reasonable, and they \u000a\u000aAtmosphere -- A hidden gem right outside of the Biltmore area.  We love the cozy, romantic atmosphere.  Nice little courtyard outside is perfect to take a break in before desset.  I prefer the clientele here over those that go to say Zinc Bistro in Scottsdale.  \u000a\u000aMy only real criticism of this place is the fact that their menu does change based upon the seasons and ingrediants available.  So, if you look on the website, you might want to call ahead to make sure they have that specific dish that you are craving!!!  \u000a\u000a(OK, not really a criticism, but it is hard to find faults in this place...)
p24
aVCoup Des Tartes is a particularly romantic place, although I've never been here with someone I had even the most remote romantic thoughts about. Isn't that funny? What's funnier is that I went here with some guy I married for our wedding night dinner! Ha-ha!*\u000a\u000aThe food is very delicious and the women that work here are uncontrollably adorable, always. It's a little dream of a house and takes you a bit out of the city when you're here.\u000a\u000a*Back story: I married some Bulgarian so he could get citizenship. It didn't work out, so we are D-I-V-O-R-C-E-D. At the ripe young age of 24, too! My grandkids are going to have a field day with me.
p25
aVOne thing to say about this place...You MUST get the Meat & Potatoes appetizer.  Hands down one of the best appetizers I've ever had anywhere, and paired with a salad, I could contemplate just eating this for dinner.  This place is SUPER cute and "romantic".  They offer BYOB service which is great...you can bring your own favorite wine/beer!  \u000aThe food was wonderful and the waitstaff seemed knowledgeable in what they were serving and made some good recommendations.  \u000aI can't wait to go back!
p26
aVCoup des Tartes gets two stars for two reasons:\u000a\u000a1) The edifice itself is charming; quaint and a delightful setup to a romantic evening.\u000a2) The wait staff is friendly, courteous, and takes time to answer questions.\u000a\u000aThe food, however, is not particularly well prepared; hence the two star rating.  It is unfortunate because if the meal had been outstanding, I would easily love this place.  Also, it is BYOB for wine.  Puh'lease.  Do NOT open a french restaurant and have an adequate supply of sylvaners, and bordeaux's, and the like on hand.  \u000a\u000aIf you don't know much about food, it's easy to fall in love with this place.  If you care about the food more than the building it's served in, you will walk about disappointed.
p27
aVA group of friends and I visited Coup Des Tartes for the first time on Friday night, and we had a fantastic time -- echoing many of the reviews before me.  The BYOB ($8 corking fee but they were sweetly not paying attention to how many bottles we opened) situation just makes me happy and always ensures a happy table.\u000a\u000aThe menu is small but it was all right up my alley and I had a hard time deciding which app/salad/entree/dessert -- strong options in all categories.  Our table got the brie brulee appetizer, which wasn't anything complicated but yummy nonetheless.  We shared some salads (a split brie and pear salad for me...sense a trend?) and then I ordered the sea bass for an entree.  It was absolutely delicious!  Toss in the chocolate lover's dessert and I was in love.\u000a\u000aOur service was impeccable and the energy from the staff was perfect for our Friday night.  The place is very small and I loved that; felt more like a restaurant in NYC vs. Phoenix.  Reservations are a requirement from what I understand, which makes sense with the small # of tables.  Entrees are in the $25-$35 range, but are very well-prepared and have good portions.  Food is pricey but at the end of the day my group was out of there at $55/person with tip included -- not bad at all (especially with one of the dishes being the lobster)!
p28
aVLoved this place!  I am a huge fan of the whole flip-the-house-and-turn-it-into-a-great-restaurant idea....Now I know this place has been around for a while, but this was my first time there and my wife and I were blown away.\u000aBeing half French, my taste buds were excited upon first glance of the menu...but then I noticed hints of Morocco and other countries littered throughout the menu.  \u000aThe brie brulee with caramelized apples was a true vision and the pate was wonderfully complimented by a tangy dijon mustard.  We opted for the lamb shank and pork tenderloin ( all farm animals baby! ) as our entrees.  These dishes blew us out of the water!  \u000aYou must go as soon as possible!
p29
aVWe went for the Valentines Day dinner.  It was cute, really nice and more food in one sitting than I have had in a long time.  It was pricey but worth it in my eyes.  We brought our own wine we purchased in Sonoma and were saving for a special night.\u000a\u000aService was wonderful.  The ambiance is romantic and sweet.  The brie was so good, I could have just eaten the entire plate and been completely satisfied but of course, I had soup, the main dish, dessert and wine.  \u000a\u000aGreat place for a romantic date.
p30
aVCute little place with amazing service and food. Parking is not fun because the lot is tiny. This restaurants looks like it used to be a house. Adorable. We had the brie brule with fruit for appetizer and it is to die for! Banana brulee for dessert was delicious too.\u000a\u000aYou are welcome and almost seems expected to bring your own wine because right when we were seated we were asked if we did.  I think my friend make reservations via opentable.
p31
aVMy boyfriend summed up our experience at Coup Des Tartes pretty well, even with the spelling and grammar issues - I swear he's college educated; he just thinks it's 'kool' to 'right' in his own unique style :)\u000a\u000aI'm just going to add my own two cents...\u000aAfter reading so many great reviews of this place, we were both pretty excited to try it out.  I made our reservations online with no problem.  As he said, going on a Wednesday night was perfect - it was not too crowded and we received great service. Claire and Mona took great care of us... great ambiance and food too - To start, I went with the Roquefort Salad (their signature salad) and it was delicious! Jared was happy with his mussels appetizer as well.  They brought plenty of bread and butter for him to sop up the sauce as well - it too was fresh, moist, and yummy. Jared had the chicken entree and I had the lobster... I really enjoyed it - the lobster itself was flavorful and it also had a light sweet sauce (with coconut) that enhanced each bite.  I liked that it came with asparagus as well as a risotto.  I didn't love that the risotto had pineapple in it, but that may be just me.  We didn't need it but J twisted my arm to share a dessert... chocolate crusted cheesecake with an orange sauce and fresh berries - the perfect sweet ending to a wonderful meal!\u000a\u000aIf you like quaint, unique, local places, check out Coup Des Tartes - you won't be disappointed!
p32
aVLoved it!!!\u000a\u000aWe went there last Friday night to be romantic and it definitely did the trick. I had never experienced a BYOB restaurant before and after experiencing it first hand I am hooked. We started the evening with the fillet Mignon tacos and they were fabulous, the perfect start. I had the chicken breast. It was stuffed with goodness and was served with squash, corn, and garlic mashed potatoes. A drizzle of pesto lined the outside of the dish and was the perfect accompaniment. My husband has the salmon as was very impressed (I don't do fish so I can't go into more detail). For dessert we had the four berry tarte, it was warm and the perfect end to a fabulous meal. They serve the type of food that continues to come up in conversation throughout the evening, in a good way.
p33
aVWell, there aren't many places that let you bring your own wine to the table in Phoenix, and the food is great as well.\u000a\u000aCoup Des Tartes has a distinctly Napa Vally feel to the ambiance.  The food is very good, though not among the best in Phoenix, and reasonably priced.  A truly fun and magical place to take someone special.\u000a\u000aYou have to try it for yourself!  One of my favorites for a nice, slow, date.
p34
aVThis place is great! The food is wonderful, the place is charming, the service is excellent, and the ambience is beautiful. My husband took me here on a Saturday night, and while the restaurant was full, it was not busy, and we did not feel rushed (unlike many smaller restaurants). We brought a bottle of our own wine, and enjoyed lots of yummy food. \u000a\u000aFor starters we began with the Three Onion Tarte. The crust was heavenly, and the gruyere was perfectly baked. We also had the mozzarella and tomato, and parmigiano salads. The mozzarella was fresh, creamy, and very tasteful. For entrees we had the Farfalle pasta, which tasted just as amazing as it smelled. We also had the Filet Mignon.  The meat was perfectly medium, and the horseradish and black pepper creme fraiche was to die for. For dessert we had the Four Berry Tarte, which was fantastic. \u000a\u000aWe left extremely happy, our bellies full but not overly FULL. The prices are a little up there, but it's worth it. We'll definitely be coming back soon, as the menu changes seasonally. Yum!
p35
aVOhh la la! This place made me want to learn French. I went there with my bro and sis- in laws as well as my mother in law and my husband. We each brought in our own bottle of wine. I love BYOBs because you can really splurge on your food AND drink delicious wines. This place did the trick! We had the Interested Cheeses (my sis-in-law and I love cheese) and the Filet Mignon taco for starters. I can't vouch for the tacos, but I think my husband would have fought me for it. \u000a\u000aFor our entrees I had the salmon which was cooked to perfection! I even ended up eating off other plates with salmon after they were full I loved it so much! My husband loved the Filet Mignon as well. I do think it was here where he discovered he really did like salmon. \u000a\u000aOf course, we had to have dessert, too! We got the chocolate mocha and the four berry tartes. Even if you are full, get a tarte to go! \u000a\u000aI really want to go back to try the farfalle..Maybe this weekend??\u000a\u000aI guess it is good for groups but call ahead. Its a tight squeeze!
p36
aVI hate to do this after so many good reviews, but the service was not the best I've ever received.  I saw the great review in the "Best of Phoenix," so I wanted to check it out on Friday night.  When we arrived, we were sat at a blank table (no linens, plates, silverware).  The host quickly brought all of that to the table.  He left... and it actually took 5 minutes for the server to even come to the table and ask what kind of water we wanted.  After delivering the water, she went to make several cappucinos and grab desserts from the back for another table.  This literally took about 13 minutes.  Not once did she explain that she was busy or that it would be a few minutes before she could get back with us.  I was on the verge of walking out, but decided to try the food.\u000a\u000aThe food is definitely worth the horrible service I received.  I might give it another try since our server may have been having a bad day... but, a restaurant has to maintain great service... otherwise, people won't want to give a second chance.
p37
aVCoup Des Tartes was really a 3.5 experience for me, but I'm going to round up.\u000a\u000aMy husband and I chose Coup Des Tartes for our anniversary dinner this year for a few reasons - 1. BYOB.  2. We love French food and always go to a French restaurant for our anniversary and 3. Its billed as being romantic.  Those seem like pretty reasonable requirements, right?\u000a \u000aFirst of all, this is not French food.  Sure, there are French inspirations and they serve brie but the menu is largely American with all sorts of influences.  (My husband's entrée had cous cous!)  Second of all, I didn't find it romantic.  I guess if you use romantic to mean the same things an East Coaster means when they say "intimate" or "cozy"....which to everyone else means cramped.  I wouldn't have minded the close quarters had it not been so loud!  The loud ambiance and the bright lights killed most of the romantic atmosphere.\u000a \u000aThe food was solidly good.  There was no "close my eyes and savor" moment.  My husband enjoyed his lamb, even if it was definitely not a French preparation.  I ordered the lobster, as I've heard Australian lobster is the best of the Pacific lobsters.  It was good but I'll take a Maine lobster any day.  Naturally, we had a tarte for dessert. I have to say was the most dissapointing part.  I was expecting one large circular tarte and what was placed in front of me was a pie slice of a tarte.  \u000a \u000aI think that Coup Des Tartes would work best for a small group....I think 6 may be too big.  It does work for a date, just don't expect it to be too romantic.  The prices aren't outrageous so it would make a nice night out with a significant other or friends.  I think for a special occasion you can do better.

VExcellent food, delicately prepared and presented with class in a gorgeous setting.\u000a\u000aThe atmosphere of the restaurant reminds me of a Lyonnaise or Aix-en-Provence cafe. Frequented by more mature locals, it is quiet and composed, an excellent place for conversation. It's a little rustic and by no means formal; the service is inviting and just standoffish in southern French fashion. Best for smaller groups, no more than 4-6 people.\u000a\u000aI've tried two dishes here, the Coq au Vin and the Salmon, and they both blow me away in terms of flavour. The portions are intelligently small, and each meal comes with some of the best mini-croissants I've ever tasted and a rotating dessert. \u000a\u000aThe only fault I can find are the prices; at $7-$10 a meal, I feel almost obliged to use the tip keep from feeling guilty. An absolute steal, hidden away.
p43
aVWonderful food, great ambiance, fabulous service!  This could be my new favorite place for breafast/brunch. We both had the ham quiche and oh my was it ever yummy!  The mini-croissants and jam were just as good.  The complimentary chocoate cake with vanilla ice cream rounded out a perfect meal.  And the price can't be beat - $22 for two meals and drinks.  I'm heading back next weekend!!
p44
aVThis little place adjoins the main restaurant, Vincent's on Camelback, by Chef Vincent Gerithault (sp?).  All simple and astonishingly delicious dishes.  I've had their salads, coq au vin, burgundy beef, salmon, specials, desserts, and not a dog in the bunch.  Service has been spot on.  Every time.  The atmosphere is "French country" and very comfortable.   When the bill comes, it almost appears to missing a digit - it's very affordable.  The whole place exists for the sheer purpose of sharing the chef's delicious, beautifully-presented meals.    \u000a\u000aThe main restaurant is there to really showcase the Chef's true talent and should not be missed.  It's a great value as well, but expect to pay for a real meal.\u000a\u000aOne last thing, during the cooler months, the parking lot at Vincent's (Cmbk, West of 40th St) is turned into something like a farmer's market with a lot of delicious food served up.  It's very comfortable with a European feel and usually well-attended.  It's a great way to taste some great food.
p45
aVThis is one of those places I wish we could give 1/2 stars.  I would give this place 4 1/2 stars.  Really really good . . . but not out of this world fantastic.  The pizza is on par and may be better than pizzeria bianco - plus not the 4 hour wait.  We walked right in - it is very cute and charming.  It is a great place to go when you want high end food without the high end hassle.
p46
aVTheir prix fixe menu gives almost unbelievable value on truly fine eats. Truly fine. And some nice-priced tasty wines. Not for the real snobs, maybe (they go to the fancy end of the building), but this place is absolutely one of the best of the best - I'd give it 6 stars if I could, and I eat out a lot and in many different places. Stop reading & get your tookis to Vincent's Bistro.
p47
aVAbsolutely delicious! Best value for upscale restaurant in Phoenix. Coq au vin was great. Save room for the lemon soufflé crepe. Waiter and service were terrific.
p48
aVWelcome to Paris in the desert. Je t'aime Vincent's. Anything Vincent's does I love. Whether it's the 5 star dining in the front, the market bistro in the back or the Saturday morning marketplace outside. They really know how to frenchafy AZ. \u000a\u000aI've been to Vincent's Market Bistro several times and most recently, last night for a friend's birthday. The Market Bistro is the more intimate, kitchen style dining at Vincent's and actually my favorite way to dine there. I walked in and immediately felt like I'd entered a cozy and intimate restaurant in the heart of Paris. The food was cooking, the guests at the tables were laughing and having a great time and the waitstaff knew almost everyone by name. The authentic french decor helped the cause as well. \u000a\u000aWhen I hear the name Vincent's, I immediately think "oh yikes, here comes a pricey night," but the best part about it is that the market bistro keeps the evening at an incredibly reasonable price without losing the quality of food. Are you ready for this? I got the pre fix meal that began with a delectable crab cake on a salad with avocado garnish, followed by the lobster chimichanga and topped off with the chocolate tart which was really a chocolate souffle. How much? $20. Only $20 my friends! It was delicious. With each savory bite, I became a little happier. The wine by the glass was only $5-$6 dollars and at the end, the waiter brought us a couple additional desserts to make sure we tried them all. Just what my waistline needed...but I had a bite, and I think the lemon tart is my favorite. \u000a\u000aVincent's Market Bistro has definitely been added to the rotation of favorite places to dine with character. And when I walked outside and the heat hit my face, I didn't even mind because I had such a great time at Vincent's.

aVWhat a great way to get Vincent quality food for a nomial price. They have a wonderful patio you can sit at, and the docor inside is fantastic as well. Food was fantastic, as is to be expected.
p50
aVThis is my FAVORITE restaurant in Phoenix. Cannot wait to go back. Service, food and ambiance and price for what you get ( price fix menu) were great. The only small issue was that it was really packed with people & some of the people in wheelchairs/walkers had a tough time getting through. They even have a cookbook!
p51
aVGotta give it 5 stars.  I wouldn't change a thing about it, from the ambience to the server to the food quality. \u000a\u000aTo start, like a reviewer said before me, the valet parking does seem to be for the actual Vincent restaurant, rather than for the Bistro.  And yes, there is parking in the back.\u000a\u000a**Another note**:  The Market Bistro only takes reservations for parties of 5 or more.  Two of us went at 7:00 on a Tuesday night and were seated immediately.\u000a\u000aWhat we ate that we actually ordered:  Lobster bisque, salmon quesadillas, coq au vin, seafood skewers.\u000a\u000aWhat the server brought-- for free for us to try-- which we ate but hadn't ordered:  The butternut squash ravioli, mini pumpkin chocolate brownie with ice cream on top.  (And of course the mini croissants at the beginning of the meal.)\u000a\u000aEverything we ate was beyond fantastic, with one exception-- the seafood skewers were a little bland.  Not "bad" by any means, just not as flavorful as seafood can be.  The real standout was the butternut squash.  Our second favorite was the salmon quesadillas.  EXCELLENT.\u000a\u000aEven better:  our entire bill, including my friend's glass of wine and my soft drink, was $48!!\u000a\u000aI will go back again and again.  (And to all you thriving young bucks, this would be the perfect place to take a first date-- classy and unique, yet unpretentious, with amazing food and a manageable cost.  Score!)
p52
aVMy experience at Vincents was truly excellent. I went in the middle of the week during a decently busy time and was seated very quickly at a nice table for two near the back. \u000a\u000aI have never been to France but I think that this is what it would feel like. Great decor, wine bottles being opened frequently, and excellent food that I can't pronounce. \u000a\u000aI had the Duck Confit and loved it. The duck had a nice skin on it and it was presented on top of a bed of lentils that complimented the richness of the Duck very nicely. The house salad was crisp and fresh and the dessert, which was brought out for free, was a delight.\u000a\u000aHad the privilege of meeting both the manager and the head chef and can say that both are wonderful people who are passionate about giving great experiences and great food. \u000a\u000aBe aware that there are no reservations for small parties but I can't think of a better place for a great date that won't break the bank. \u000a\u000aBe sure to check out their website for a list of what is on the menu because it does change from time to time.
p53
aVGreat spot for excellent food at excellent prices.  Portions are on the small but sufficient size, helping keep the prices in line.  Try the $20 three course dinner.
p54
aVThis place is outstanding! Great deal for french country bistro food. Very reasonable pricing, $20 for 3 course menu or order a la carte even cheaper.\u000a\u000aI am the youngest person in there by about 40 years every time I go but I don't care, I don't know anywhere else in the valley that has the same combo of charm, service, food quality, and cheap prices as this place. \u000aIs the food culinary magic? NO, but who would expect it to be at $20 for 3 courses?  Are portions huge? NO, but you can't even get out of cheesecake factory at that price (not that I'd want 3 courses at cheesecake, but you get the idea...).\u000a\u000aUnfortunately word is getting out and it is getting more and more crowded every time I go!! Great part is they will sometimes allow overflow to sit in one of the actual Vincent's dining rooms which instantly expands seating!
p55
aVOn a Sunday morning in phoenix, you are often left thinking about the fact that a good breakfast is neither close nor available.  In fact, you could sum up the valleys breakfast nooks as vacant or un found.  There is one beacon of breakfast hope that can be found in the central corridor, and Vincents be thy name.\u000a\u000aObviously Vincents is a culinary staple in the valley that is known far and wide and adorned by all.  What is somewhat unknown to valley foodies is that right behind the main Vincents restaurant sits "Vincents Bistro."  What does that mean to the food masses? The best price point in the valley on fine dining in a great setting.  Before you engage the menu, make sure to enjoy the house made croissants and butter, this little treat will get your senses going in the right direction.  \u000a\u000aThe menu at the Bistro is not complex(neither is the main dining room), but has staples such as Vincents famous smoked salmon quesedilla($10) and main lobster with handmade basil pasta($14).  The Bistro has a daily prix fixe menu that uses the following methodology. An appetizer of choice, a main entree of choice and dessert.  The price tag is never greater than $20 for the prix fixe and I challenge another restaurant in the valley to beat it.  Choices can range from prime new york steak, to lamb chops to a wonderfully cooked piece of fish.\u000a\u000a\u000aWhat are the cons? Good luck coordinating a take out order with the normal busyness of the operation.  Wait times for pick up can range from forty-five minutes to over an hour.  If you feel like your caught in the middle of a whirlwind circus when picking up your order, don't worry, that's just the normal pace.  \u000a\u000aIn 1982 Vincent Guerithault catapulted Arizona into the beginning phases of the culinary elite the other larger metropolis cities were already enjoying.  Now, thirty years later, he has done it again with the Bistro.  I applaud Vincent and his family on their success and longevity in the valley culinary circuit.
p56
aVThis place is absolutely amazing!!! The food was outstanding, the portions perfect, and the service excellent! Can't wait to go back soon :)
p57
aVI know I don't live here anymore, but I remember hitting up Vincent Market Bistro on the weekend after a nice hike up Camelback. This is a great place to just come, relax, and enjoy a nice weekend  brunch.\u000a\u000aThe food is fresh and outstanding, and as always, the service is perfect.\u000a\u000aGreat place to take people who are in town visiting for a truly exceptional meal.
p58
aVId love to share with you my new go-to date night spot. It's filled with so much charm and romance we both were simply glowing with post dinner elation. The place, Vincent's Market Bistro is the scaled down version of the fine dining classic Vincent's of Camelback. It's funny that a place like this is so well hidden without even a hint of signage beyond a sandwich board on the street. Just look for the main Vincent's sign and follow it around back to the Market Bistro entrance, they're housed in the same building. \u000a\u000aChef and owner Vincent Guerithault keeps the menu decidedly French with hints of Southwestern flare that he's so famous for. You should look this guy up; he's got some accolades including a James Beard award under his belt. Does kudos translate to good cookery, you bet!\u000a \u000aFor one of my favorites, be sure to look for the Curly Endive Salad ($9) with mustard dressing, bacon, and a poached egg. I saw it, I ordered it, I swooned over it. A well balanced ratio of salty, sweet and sour then fresh cracked pepper completes the equation. \u000a\u000aPizza offerings are done well with a tender pale crust that seemed more akin to pastry then to your typical chewy crispy offering. Tarte Flambée ($8) was topped with a light cream sauce, bacon, onion and thyme. Another pork laden pizza was the Caprese ($8) topped with pesto, arugula, mozzarella and prosciutto. I just wished that the greens were put on after cooking instead of before.\u000a\u000aFor dinner you'll find classics including the cooked in its own fat Crispy Duck Confit ($16) with lentils and bacon, sensing a porky theme here? The tender mallard leg was succulent and intense in flavor while the lentils performed well by countering the richness of the meat. For something a little bit lighter, I use that word loosely, order up the Coq au Vin ($10). Red wine braised chicken served atop gratin potatoes were hearty and comforting. \u000a\u000aVincent's Market Bistro also offers a $20, 3 course Prix Fixe menu. On my last visit delights were abound with the likes of creamy Butternut Squash Ravioli, Rainbow Trout and a scrumptiously sour Lemon Tart. This has to be one of the best deals in town that I know of. I mean really, food from a James Beard award winning chef at these prices is unheard of. \u000a\u000aGreat food, good prices and excellent service all set in a romantic atmosphere, well; there is one caveat, the hours. Vincent's Market Bistro closes at 8pm, so plan on eating early. We arrived around 6pm on a Saturday night and by 7pm the place was completely filled. Be sure to check their website for times including breakfast, brunch and lunch.
p59
aVWe went here late, about a half hour before close. The place was packed and the only table available was on the patio. We kind of stood around and they told us we could sit there if we wanted to. We sat down, but there were still other people waiting who apparently didn't want to sit outside. I don't know if we were hard to see or if its just because they were busy, but we waited at least 20 minutes before anyone came to our table. \u000a\u000aI ordered the prix fixe (butternut squash ravioli, beef brisket, and some eclaire type dessert that started with a p). My girlfriend had the pizza with bacon. \u000a\u000aI don't know if its because it is a european style restaurant or what, but every course took forever, it took us two and a half hours to have dinner.\u000a\u000aMy squash ravioli in creme sauce was amazing, but there were literally only two of them. \u000a\u000aThe croissant basket that we received was ok, they were a little burned.\u000a\u000aThe beef brisket was awful. It was soaked in some kind of sauce that reminded me of gym socks. I would not order it again. The veggies on the side were lightly cooked, very little seasoning, and very fresh, these were great.\u000a\u000aMy girlfriend said her pizza was ok, but not anything special. \u000a\u000aThe dessert is what really stole the show. I have no idea what mine was called (it started with a P and was really long, I couldn't pronounce it), but dear god it was amazing. I could have eaten a meal of just that. \u000a\u000aThey did bring my girlfriend a small brownie with ice cream as well, which she appreciated. \u000a\u000aI don't know if we would go back if this is a typical dinner experience. Maybe just get dessert to go.

VMarche Bacchus is a hidden gem in the desert of Las Vegas.  Situated right next to a lake, this restaurant and wine shop is a fabulous place to enjoy a leisurely lunch (or dinner) with excellent company.\u000a\u000aFor our dining enjoyment, my companion and I shared the Bacchus Grazing Platter ($18, Selection of Imported Cheese, Meats, Lobster Salad, Smoked Salmon, Olives, Fruit, Onion Marmalade served with French Baguette); Salad Bacchus ($8, Goat cheese Croutons, Mesclun salad, Pine Nuts, Beurre Rouge); and the Lobster Avacado Croissant ($9, Celery, sliced Tomatoes and Lemon Vinaigrette). \u000a\u000aThe Bacchus Grazing Platter was a fabulous choice!  They offered three cheeses - brie, blue, and morbier.  The morbier was absolutely delicious, but the blue was a bit too crumbly for my choice.  This is an excellent choice if you're ordering wine too.  (We had to pass, it was our first meal of the day.)  \u000a\u000aThe Lobster Avocado Croissant was stuffed with lots of lobster salad.  Very yummy, but I would have wanted a bit more avocado in my sandwich.  (It is called a Lobster Avocado Croissant after all.)  A side of Caesar salad accompanied this sandwich.  \u000a\u000aLast to arrive was the Bacchus Salad.  After already dining on the wine platter and the sandwich, we could have done without the salad.  My companion did enjoy the goat cheese croutons, but the salad was average.  \u000a\u000aThe great thing about this place is that you can go through their wine selection (they are a wine shop after all), pick a bottle of wine and enjoy that bottle with your meal.  (There's a $10 corkage fee.)  \u000a\u000aService was okay.  Our waiter was average.  He never bothered telling us the daily special or anything.  The waitress who took over his shift was much better and a lot more pleasant.  I could hear her interactions with the other diners was much more impressed with her customer service skills than our waiter.\u000a\u000aAnd of course, please sit outside when dining here, especially for lunch.  With a shaded area and a mist, it's not hot out and the view of the lake makes it a fabulous place to just sit, relax, eat, drink, and just immerse yourself in the company of your dining companion(s).\u000a\u000aIt can easily be a romantic spot if you let it be, or go with friends and enjoy a couple of glasses of wine.  They are soon to be offering wine tasting events in the near future which I would definitely be interested if I were in the area more often.\u000a\u000aEat, drink, and be merry!\u000a\u000aThey are open for Sunday brunch (10 am to 3 pm); Lunch (10:30 am to 4 pm) and Dinner (4:30pm-10pm).\u000a\u000a(Check out the photos of our meal above!)

aVthis is another one of the best kept secrets here in vegas.  it is located on the outskirts of the summerlin area called desert shores.  right when you walk in youll notice that it is a wine shop with a fantastic selection.  pass on through the end and youll see a small restaurant with outdoor patio seating overlooking a small blue lake.  \u000amy lovely date and i started off with the grazing platter, which had a variety of cheese, such as brie, blue cheese, and morbier (completely new to me...pungent and delicious), salami, lobster salad, smoked salmon, olives, apples, onion marmalade, and sweet pickles.  we then continued with the lobster avocado croissant (my mouth is watering right now)   we finished with the bacchus salad which had these great flavorful croutons, and yummy goat cheese.  i just love goat cheese.  i will definitely return to this place again for lunch or dinner.  i heard that i have to try the mussels and have order a bottle of wine.    i think it will be another lovely date with her again...\u000a12/15/06-i just went to dinner last night...holy WOW!!!  i had the grazing platter again, which complemented our tuscan wine so tastefully, especially bringing out the flavors of the pate.  for an entree, i ordered the ctelettes de porc, which was a grilled bone-in pork chop crispy and crusted with the sharp goat cheese and pine nuts, served with sauted green Beans, toasted almonds and roasted garlic demi-glace (with whole garlic cloves)!!!  and for dessert....Tarte Tatin, an upside down (very sour) apple tart sweetened with vanilla ice cream and caramel sauce.  the crme brule a la Vanille was eh all right. the cateau au chocolat had a warm fudge brownie with warm cherry compote, where you would dunk each bite into shot of warm chocolate milk...yum-yum...i also loved the crusty edged bread pudding au chocolate, so each bite consisted of melted chocolate, with chewy bread that was crunchy on the outsidel.  so, now i have upgraded this place to a five star.  the prices aren't outrageous...the wine selection is huge, and since it is winter they still have outdoor seating but under a heated clear plastic tent, so you can still enjoy the view of the lake.  like i said before, i will be returning to this place again...with my lovely dining companion...i cant wait....i wonder if she feels the same way, too...
p66
aVOff the strip and off the beaten path.  At the edge of Summerlin off the 95 at Buffalo to Desert Shores, a planned community on a man made lake.  This amazing french restaurant is a locals favorite.  It sits on the lake with inside and outside bistro seating.  The wine store in the front of the house is the most complete you will find in vegas. The food here is authentic french.  Omelettes like you will find in Paris (the french can cook an egg, so please folks, don't ruin this one by ordering it eggs white only!!!).  Amazing charcuterie as well as stand-bys like onion soup and hachis parmentier (sheperds pie).  Great spot for outdoor dining.
p67
aVIf you are ever in Vegas, just driving thru and need an emergency place to eat to simply find peace and great service with a nice European touch, you can't beat Marche Bacchus.\u000a\u000aLocated away from the glamour and gaudy strip, this is a store that sells fine wines of many varieties but it is also a wonderful lakeside brunch place.  I was here last month on a mildly warm 80 degree Vegas spring day and there couldn't be a better place than on the patio covered under the shade of gently nodding trees and in the company of a touching zephyr breeze amind the cyan colored artificial lake.\u000a\u000aThe service is perfect.  You don't feel rushed, but at the same time, when you order, your food is there pretty quickly.  The menu is simple to read with typical french classics like French Onion soup, but the wines are superb as well.  The desserts, especially the bread pudding, are sinful and I really didn't want to leave.\u000a\u000aThis is a wonderful place to dine at if you are passing thru Vegas.  I was on my way to Flagstaff and was revitalized by this place.
p68
aVMy first visit here was awesome; however, I went back last week with a friend and was somewhat disappointed. The restaurant was recently sold.  So, the new owners and chef have already changed the menu with the claim of taking the restaurant to the next level.   The food was average and service was poor.  We had to ask for bread & butter.  Also, apple tart was suppose to be served with vanilla ice cream instead server brought it with mango ice cream.  He stated, that the kitchen made the decision to substitute since they ran out of vanilla?  They obviously have some work to do.  Of course, wine can cure many ills.
p69
aVHalf wine shop, half french restaurant; this Desert Shores Epicurean delight is 100% terrific.  It isn't everyday you stumble upon a little spot like this where you can get a croque monsieur or a nice french cheese plate to go with a terrific wine selection.  You can pick a wine from the store side and the corkage fee is just 10 bucks.  The patio overlooks the lake and is an idyllic setting for a leisurely lunch.
p70
aVAlthough the ambiance, wine store and service is superb, I find this to be one of the most overrated restaurants in Las Vegas. To describe the food as lack luster is actually kind. The onion soup I had was bland and the lobster croissant sandwich was an affront to good seafood. I specifically asked about the quality of the lobster meat and was assured that is was "wonderful". When the sandwich arrived it had the shredded consistency of canned lobster and the bread was a cheap croissant that was way too buttery (not even close to the pastry pictured in the photos from the restaurant). It was the first time I can remember actually being angry at my lunch.\u000aThe wine shop , however, is excellent and they only charge $10 for a corkage fee. Although,  I can't understand why they don't have a wine list. You are forced walk around the shop to find what you want, which is usually a wonderful, but occasionally I find that it would be nice to have a list to guide you.
p71
aVAfter looking for a particular wine around town (Tobin James), I finally found a bottle here at Marche Bacchus.  The staff was very helpful, the selection was good, and the prices seemed fair.  I'll definitely be back to pick up some more wine from this spot.
p72
aVThe concept is great, and the location is grand . . . but,\u000a\u000aHad some pretty bad service here at lunch.\u000a\u000aThat aside, the food was good (although we had to send a steak back) and the small markup on wine is a great way to spend an afternoon.\u000a\u000aFor a couple of dude's spending $300 at lunch though, it would have been nice to not have to flag someone down for everything.\u000a\u000aEnjoy the lake, and the retail pricecd wine, and you'll have a grand old time.
p73
aVI showed up here the day after it snowed in Las Vegas to find that it was too cold to sit outside by the fire overlooking the lake. So we sat inside and had a bottle of bubbly. \u000a\u000aThe food is fair but the idea of the place and the atmosphere is fantastic. Buy the wine retail and add $10 to drink it in the dining room. Cool!\u000a\u000a We had the fettuccine pesto with chicken and it was hearty but otherwise not flavorful enough. The moules frites were perfectly cooked and my favorite dish of the evening. The paella dish didn't have enough paella! The flavor was quite good though.\u000a\u000aThe service we had was fine. Of course,... we were only one of 2 tables on a Thursday night.
p74
aVAmazing location! Sitting out on the patio overlooking the lake is breathtaking and makes you forget you're in Vegas. They have a great selection of wine in the store and are really helpful if you need some help making a choice. Great place to stop by after work for a drink with friends or a romantic dinner with the boyfriend.
p75
aVWe had a 5 course tasting menu while dining at Marche Bacchus. Our first course was a seared scallop with caviar on top and a micro green salad on the side. It was so sweet and delicately cooked to perfection. Our second course was a duck done 3 ways dish.  On top a very generous portion of foie gras that was crispy and so melt-in your mouth soft in the center. Third was the meat course, I'm a beginning eat meater for my filet was a little under done but to everyone else it was cooked well. Lastly they brought out an espresso cake with liquid chocolate ganash on the side to pour over it, it was perfection.\u000a\u000aWe found a couple of bottles of wine and that my partner said were very well priced to enjoy over dinner. Great selection of wine by the glass along with their bottles. The manager was very well knowledged and didn't pick out the most expensive bottle when we asked him for suggestions, but picked out bottles that best fit the description of the wine we wanted to purchase.\u000a\u000aThe wine shop offers *FREE* wine tasting on Saturday mornings from 1130-230.  It's never really crowed, but  a good way to get people interested in the restaurant and wine shop.\u000a\u000aCan't wait to eat there again!
p76
aVSuperior Food. Superior Service. Unique Atmosphere. Critically Expensive.\u000a^^^ The story is short.\u000a\u000avvv The story is long.\u000aThis is a true fine dining experience. A "French" Restaurant experience. If you don't know what that means or even care, skip this review and find somewhere else to hang out. For the uninitiated, the price tag alone can give a heart attack. My girlfriend and I wracked up just shy of $200 with an appropriate tip for dinner...just the two of us.  This experience can basically be summed up by combining a very proud chef with a huge, small-lot wine cellar offered at retail. \u000a\u000aYou dine at Marche Bacchus because you want to be serenaded by ducks lakeside...our table was spitting distance to the water...with a babbling brook behind us. \u000a\u000aYou dine at Marche Bacchus because you want an Angus Ribeye cooked EXACTLY PERFECTLY AS YOU ORDERED IT, not overcooked. \u000a\u000aYou dine at Marche Bacchus because you want to celebrate a fine event. \u000a\u000aYou dine at Marche Bacchus because you have $200 extra dollars you don't know what to do with. \u000a\u000aYou dine at Marche Bacchus because it is, by and large, the epitome of fine dining Las Vegas has to offer.\u000a\u000aAccording to one popular knowledge compendium website ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Diamond_Award ) , "the AAA Five Diamond Award is the highest level of the AAA Diamond Ratings System for restaurants and lodgings administered by AAA (formerly known as the American Automobile Association). For 2008, AAA Five Diamond properties total 160 (100 hotels and 60 restaurants) ... of the 60,000 AAA Diamond Rated lodgings and restaurants..."\u000a\u000aI can just bet if there was justice in the world, Marche Bacchus would have made it 161 properties if it were indeed reviewed in 2008.\u000a\u000aOn Yelp, I rate this 4 of 5 stars, not because the restaurant is substandard in any way. If I were independantly wealthy (aka More Money Than God), I wouldn't care. But I do care, and I'm not so well off.  So, 4 stars means "Yay! I'm a Fan", and it is what it is.\u000a\u000aNow, if I were an independant restaurateur with pedigree and pride at a Lakeside Location and with a Retail Wine Collection like Marche Bacchus, I wouldn't care that people who weren't independantly wealthy couldn't afford to eat at my restaurant or buy my wines, because for them I would think it would be a once-in-a-lifetime experience with a once-in-a-lifetime price tag.\u000a\u000aI would gladly serve them Escargot as appetizers and cook them the best cut of meat I could to my own exacting standards and have them attended by wonderfully trained professional caretakers/waiters (like the one we met tonight named "Ian"), then gladly collect their $200 and send them on their way knowing I made the world a better place for them and for the culinary community.
p77
aVI find the food here completely overrated.  I have been here several times. The Napa cabbage salad was boring and bland. A bunch of shredded cabbage tossed in dressing topped with dry, flavorless chicken. Honestly, I have had a better salad from Chili's (and without the ducks begging for bread). \u000a\u000aSecond time was for dinner.  I had the Seafood Paella. Now, I am by no means a food snob.  I sneak the occasional Del Taco.  But the seafood was extremely overcooked, the rice was dry and sticky and the seasoning left much to be desired. \u000a\u000aThe wine shop is great and I usually like sitting outside by the lake.  For the price, I would go elsewhere.
p78
aVI've been here numerous times over the last 8 years but had yet to go to their happy hour.  The wines are not that inexpensive:  $8 for Chateau Monfort Vouvray Chenin Blanc & Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc to go along with the $9 happy hour specials of cheese plate, lobster monte cristo & a few other items.  On Fri they have jazz from 5-7 but the happy hr is 5-8 on M-F.  So it's a tasty bite & drink which was fun on a Fri nite so you can still go out esp if you need to get in early for Sat.
p79
aVTasty scallops, peaceful lake side view and they accomodated for my gluten-free needs which I appreciate.

aVCame here for wine tasting and dinner with a group of 20 women.  It was the perfect compliment to a decidely un-Vegas bachelorette party weekend.  Our group had a private, tented, heated "room" out on the patio, which was quite lovely on a chilly April evening.  The waitstaff was beyond attentive, and our wine glasses were never empty.  They also did a great job of teaching us about the wines we were tasting, and explaining why those particular wines had been chosen to compliment our meal.  I could have been happy with just the bread basket and soup du jour, but the rest of the meal was perfectly lovely as well.\u000a\u000aAlthough I'm not sure it would be worth the pricey cab ride to trek out here from the strip (we were just down the road at Red Rock, so it wasn't much of a drive), I'd recommend Marche Bacchus to anyone local or staying nearby.
p81
aVI unfortunately have to downgrade this restaurant to a 3 star and that is mostly based on location. \u000aPrevious owners I have to say were 5 star all the way! \u000aSadly the food and service is just not the same.\u000aThe food is good now but that is all just....good.\u000aA glass of wine and a cheese plate overlooking the lake with a decent server is all I expect now of my once beloved Marche Bacchus.

The food is delicious, and Razz knows his wine.  The ambience is excellent.  The menu changes with time as new dishes are added, but the whole experience is a treat.
p87
aVHaving made it a passion to dine at the best restaurants in the Phoenix area, I have found Razz to be the best.  I have been going here for 5 years now and find it best to sit at the bar and let him cook for me whatever he wishes.  At the bar, the service is excellent and the ambiance is wonderful.  It is hard to discern which is more captivating, the chef or the food.  \u000a\u000aIf one should choose to order from the menu, there is a vast array of excellent choices:  from the Portuguese clams to the duck, or the  bouillabaisse, the phenomenal specials...can't go wrong.\u000a\u000aThis establishment is overlooked as the onslaught of newer, flashier, trendier, albeit inferior, and more expensive places take the attention.  \u000a\u000aOne last note, it is closed in the summer because he travels around the world.  However, this can be good because he always brings back new, amazing recipes for the menu.  \u000a\u000aThis is certainly a must.
p88
aVIt was grand opening night. The space is lovely and filled with great art every where you look. Razz and his wife were excellent hosts as if you were coming in to their home making sure everyone was having a good time. The service was impeccable. I guess this place is closed during summer months I had no idea this was even here I had no idea what to expect. The only complaint I have is there wasnt enough non meat options but I bet on a regular day the regular menu would have more to chose from.\u000a\u000aThe Sepetember Wine Dinner as follows\u000aOxtail Hash with Truffle Glaze\u000aBaby mixed green bundle, toasted Macadamia nut vinaigrette\u000aPaired with Pouilly Fusse 04\u000aThe presentation was so neat pics coming soon. I could not get enough of the greens and dressing.\u000a\u000aScallop en Croute (The hugest scallop I have ever seen EVER) Seared with Fois Gras duxelle in pastry, roasted strawberry & rhubarb compote with a Mersault '04. This was so frikn good HELLO YUMGASM!!\u000a\u000aI didnt have the rest of the pairing but they seemed to go over pretty well. There was Veal Loin en Papillote steamed in a parchment bag with wild mushrooms, asparagus & morbier cheese and the main course was a Peppered Beef Tenderloin w french green beans & almonds, spinach pancake, roasted potatoes with garlic.. I didnt care for the pancake and I hate pepper and beef lol but the green beans were spectacular seriously the best I have ever had, I dont usually like garlicy things and the potato was awesome I didnt waste any. \u000a\u000aPecan Sponge Pie with a bunch of different berries was totally heavenly. All in all I really cant wait to go back when I can pick what to try!! If you have the money to splurge you need to try this place fa sho!!
p89
aVEverything was superb. It all blew me away. The wait staff was attentive to every need, the wine selection was very large, and most of all the food was to die for. There was nothing I had, from the appetizers, wine, main dish, and dessert that wasn't worthy of 5 stars. I do have to agree with others in saying that the price is better than other fine dining establishments that don't have as good of service, food, or presentation. . \u000a\u000aI had the Cashew and Rosemary encrusted Salmon (see pictures). The fish was perfectly prepared and melted in the mouth. It had a mildly sweet but rich sauce that complimented the richness of the fish. My date asked the chef to surprise him. He made him roasted duck with vegetables and new potatoes. We also had french onion soup as an appetizer and another appetizer not on the menu...both were amazing.\u000a\u000aThe open kitchen made the experience unique, as you could see everything being prepared and plated. The owner was extremely gracious as he laughed and chatted it up with EVERY table in the restaurant. It was a very special experience. I can't wait to go back!
p90
aVParelez vous en francais? Moi aussi! \u000aOk so I love the French but I usually don't do french because moi= vegetarian. I am not sure if this place is really considered french but the menu sure seemed like it to me. \u000aFrench Onion soup........done as well as it can be done. Perfect blend of onions and cheese....the best I've had in awhile. I will go back just to have it and to lick every spoonful of cheese off my spoon ever so seductively. \u000aWine list= fabulous. \u000aScallops= hmmmm I can't really remember because of that great wine I had which I forgot what it was called because I drank too much of it. But they were really good in some sort of lemon-y sauce. \u000aI loved the art for sale on the walls. I think because of all the wine I drank I almost bought the naked women tile on the back wall. Today I am glad I didn't buy it because it would clash with my decor. \u000aThe only negative thing I have to say is that the table's kinda reminded me of a grandma's table.... could use some updating. The lovely art I thought did clash with the grandma's tables. \u000aBesides that... J'adore!!
p91
aVRazz's is among my favorite places in the Valley. The food is impeccable, the wine list superb. I can't pick a favorite item, though I'm a sucker for the short ribs. FYI, I know Razz can do terrific vegetarian entrees, and according to the menu, they will create one for you on request. Razz's catered my wedding, and even I, a devout omnivore, opted for the meatless dish. Three years later, people still talk about the food at our wedding.
p92
aVMy first time at Razz last night with a group of 25. They really brought their "A" game to service us. I'm told that they are always busy...even on a Tuesday night. Hate going to a restaurant and it's 1/4 full. Scares me. This place was hoping and we added to it. \u000a\u000aThe space is done just about right...contemporary and not pretentious. We had plenty of choice on entree's (not the whole menu) and with 25 people in our group...I think I saw the bulk of the menu. I had the Bouillabaisse and guest to the right had the halibut and to the left had the short ribs. Immpressive portion was my first immpression on my dish and others as well. The broth was light, not chunky and heavy, perfect consistency as this is a soup and not a stew necessarily. Well, it was cooked perfectly and seasoned well- flavors were subtle, no one flavor overpowered the soup, and the tomato base was light. I like a little more wine flavor coming through but was not disappointed. I wish I knew how to give a half star here because Razz is not at a 5 but it could get 4 stars here. \u000a\u000aOops....salad, very imaginative, and combined 8 or 9 ingredients and again, the portion was very immpressive. They have a long life in the restaurant business, get there and enjoy.
p93
aVgreat place for atmosphere and interesting food.     if you can, sit at the chefs table !      Razz, the chef owner, will continue to place spectacular food in front of you until you can not eat another bite.   He is guaranteed to entertain you through the entire dining experience.  One of the great chefs in the valley!\u000a\u000aRazz always offers interesting wines and amazing desserts!\u000a\u000ain scottsdale, this place is a must !!!
p94
aVWhat??? This place is fantastic!! \u000a\u000aLike many others, I hesitate to write about it as it is such a little gem in the middle of strip mall hell and sometimes it is hard to get a reservation! But, Razz's is so special that I felt he was due a review! \u000a\u000aI have and will only eat at the Chef's Table as Razz is hilarious!! He is total entertainment and I just delight in everything he says and creates! \u000a\u000aSo how this works...you sit down, tell him what you like, don't like, food allergies etc and what you want to drink...the rest is in his hands! He is totally accommodating for food allergies (which the GF BF loves!) and he has some great unusual wines at fair prices! \u000a\u000aAnd then the gluttony begins....course after course comes out of AMAZING food! Everything is superb and I am always painfully stuffed when I leave as I just want to see what he makes next! We have never had the same thing twice, which is something Razz prides himself in, and we really enjoy the whole experience! Finally, when you decide to throw in the towel (my record is 7 courses!), a fantastic desert assortment comes out just to finish off a fantastic meal! One thing to remember - don't eat the bread until he tells you it is okay! \u000a\u000aRazz does close down for the summer (leaves in May, returns in October) so be sure to try it before he is gone and always check their website as they often have great coupons available.  He also stays open late too!\u000a\u000aLove it!!!!
p95
aVRazz is a real gem!\u000aThis neighborhood charmer, offers a cozy atmosphere with a touch of class. \u000a\u000aEverything that came out of the kitchen was a work of art & delicious. The Tomato Vegetable Salad displayed well with a refreshing blend of textures and tastes. The entree vegetables were crisp and flavorful, delicately tied together in a beautiful display. My mango/berry sorbet was served in a unique wedge with a wonderful presentation of colors. The was a great way to finish off a delicious dinner.\u000a\u000aThe display of art throughout the entire restaurant is very fun.\u000a\u000aRazz, I'll be back.
p96
aVOur first time was at the season ending wine dinner. There was a set menu for the event each paired with a different wine. We were not disappointed. The table included some picky eaters who were nevertheless impressed. Wonderful halibut and salmon in delicious sauce, perfectly prepared, grilled shrimp and escargot, crisp duck and beef wellington, and a dessert cake (mango) with berries. Can't wait for them to reopen in fall to try the rest of the menu.
p97
aVI have been remiss in not writing my review sooner; Razz's is now closed for summer.  I enjoyed the best meal I've ever had in my 7.5 years living in Phoenix at Razz's earlier this year.  I couldn't even tell you all the delicious things I ate now, but that's exactly the point.  I didn't order for myself - I sat at the bar and ordered the Chef's tasting menu.  Razz himself decided what he wanted us to have and stayed with us thoughout the entire meal.  He is quite the entertainer and a very interesting man, to boot.  He knows his food is good and he will certainly be happy to tell you!  The time he takes off during the summer he spends traveling the world and tasting food from all over, so he knows how his cuisine measures up.\u000a\u000aDon't let the strip mall location fool you - the inside is quite quaint and if you're going to spend the money to get a good meal in this town, turst me you won't be disappointed!
p98
aVFour stars for the Phoenix area, probably only 3-3.5 in New York, for this 'Mediterranean' (whatever that means) upscale dining spot. \u000a\u000aOne real blow-away item - the Duck Cake appetizer. This is like a Crab Cake,very tasty duck meat and no discernable filler. Would be a winner anywhere. The other appetizer we had was a very ordinary ceviche. \u000a\u000aMy main course was a special that night, Short Ribs, very well cooked, tender and seasoned just right. But it was served over a clicheed  mound of mashed potatoes.  Add another star if Razz gets a little more inventive, polenta, or something more southwestern or Mediterranean. \u000a\u000aThe other main course at the table was Double Roasted Duck. Since I like my duck breast rare, I didn't think double-roasting would do it. I was right. The skin was crisp, as advertised, but the meat was overdone and somewhat tasteless. Why not do a quick high-heat grilling to crisp and seal the skin, then a gentle roasting to medium rare. And why serve it already sliced, allowing whatever juices and flavor were there to escape? Do they think their duck is so tough, or their diners so dense, that it can't be cut by the eater? \u000a\u000aThe service was friendly and helpful, the drinks were good, but the place wasn't packed for a Friday night. Maybe they all go for the  Buy one, Get one free Monday through Thursday  special. Check their website before you go.
p99
aVwe sat at the chefs table and i love the eye contact Razz makes. some people never look you in the eye and thats a huge pet peeve of mine. but razz locks eyes and i love it. i guess you could call me an eye-locking whore.\u000a\u000aBe sure to only eat at the chefs table and just let Razz decide what you're going to eat and drink.  \u000a\u000athe first course was like a crab cake w a curry sauce and carmelized ginger. on top of bitter greens. i can't even explain it other than it was like little angels dancing in my mouth. \u000a\u000athe 2nd course made me decide that if Razz cooks me seafood I will LOVE it. it was like red snapper with a sauce that i'm just going to call butter bc it was so good and light. and then the snapper was on top of a bed of beans that were to die for. i'm sure there was a great explanation but i couldn't hear Razz over my thoughts. the "MMMMMMMMMMMMMMs" and the "OHHHHHHHHs" going on in my head were very loud. I'm sure my eyes looked like they were going to pop out of my head.\u000a\u000athis is where things start to get blurry but i'm pretty sure our 3rd course was lobster, crab and some other shell fish in filo dough on top of a tomato, basil and garlic puree. it was soooo super tasty.\u000a\u000anext was my 2nd favorite course- it was oxtail on top of a queso crisp with an avocado relish. YUM! YUMMY YUMMMMMMMM!!!!!! \u000a\u000a5th course- my least favorite- i learned that Razz can make me like seafood but he can't make me like duck. I was super adventurous and figured i'd probably like it but oh my gosh, sooooo not for me. \u000a\u000a6th course- delicious rice mixed in with oysters...or was it clams? or muscles? you get the idea, right? whatever it was, i did not find a pearl in the middle.  it had a spanish flare. it was very good. i was pretty overwhlemed and stuffed beyond measure by this point so i can't remember. and i had a glass of wine and i'm a weak drinker so for me that means borderline drunk. \u000a\u000alast was dessert- it came with a slice of passionfruit cake (not my thing), a slice of a coconut type cake (super good) and a wedge of this very intense piece of chocolate (that was totally my thing). we were so super full we had to box it but it was tasty.\u000a\u000aI could be mixing everything up and saying it wrong but the important thing to know is that "anything made in this building is the best and everyone will like"- Razz\u000a\u000aon that note, i can't wait to go back!!!!! he was sooo fun to sit and eat with, definitely be sure to eat the chefs table. BTW- restaurants.com has a $100 gift card when you spend $200- which is SOOOO doable. we had 6 courses, plus dessert and 3 glasses of wine and our bill came out to $196.\u000a\u000a196\u000a-100  coupon\u000a____\u000a96 \u000a / 2 diners= about $50 per person plus tip.

aVfour of us did the chef's tasting menu-- a totally spontaneous offerings given some parameters that you convey to your waitress at the git go: no pork, no goat cheese. the restaurant is located in a mall, the ambiance-- how does one explain it-- cozy, semi elegant, lo lit with a long bar on one side. four of  us took a seat at the corner where we could face each other. the four courses i remembered: a beggars purse, a fish, lobster, a chicken in crepe. quite good. i would love to try the regular menu next time.
p101
aVI was disappointed. The ratings and reviews on Yelp raised my expectations for this place. If you're a local I can see the appeal. Great wait staff, personalized service, and the chef even mingled with the crowd. BUT if you're in town on business save yourself a trip. This place is just OK. I had the short ribs, which by the way some on Yelp raved about. Where I come from they'd call it pot roast. The calamari and shrimp appetizers were just average.
p102
aVThank you Razz and staff for a delightful meal tonight!  \u000a\u000aI've driven by Razz's Restaurant countless times over the years, and in addition to the glowing reviews on Yelp, my friend and former boss, Linda L, raves and raves about how Razz's is her favorite restaurant in the Valley.  So, after all of this time, I finally made it in - partially because of the convenient location, but mostly because I wanted to try something new.\u000a\u000aWe had a group of six, and we were celebrating my mom's birthday.  I made an 8pm reservation and we waited just a couple of minutes when we arrived before we were seated at our table.  PJ was our waiter and took fabulous care of us.  Fresh bread and water were served promptly, and Jared chose a bottle of Argentenian Cabernet-Syrah blend  for the table...\u000a\u000aWe shared the Baked Cheese in Phyllo, Crispy Calamari, and Bah Mie Goreng as appetizers... all were delicious.  The calamari had a unique creamy preparation and a major kick to it.  \u000a\u000aFor entrees, three of us (including me) had the Arroz con Mariscos (Razz doesn't skimp on the seafood - this dish was huge and flavorful; kind of like a combination between paella and risotto).  My mom went with the shortribs (which I tried and fell in love with instantly), mom-in-law had a macadamia encrusted grouper special which was supposedly incredible as well, and Jared had the Chicken Scaloppini which he said was "off the charts!"\u000a\u000aMom was given a complimentary birthday dessert which we all shared, and was the perfect sweet ending to our meal.  I didn't get a chance to chat with Razz but I will have to return and sit at the Chef's Table next time for sure.  And I can guarantee that "next time" will be sooner rather than later!
p103
aVI have been telling my friends about this amazing gem since I started going there 12 years ago.  Razz is a true chef. Passionate about his food, full of life and incredibly fun to dine with at his Chef's table at the bar.  But I have to say, his Boulliabase is the best in town.  I crave it!  I also crave almost everything on the menu...the duck cakes are his signature and a must have for sure!  This intimate, art gallery dining room welcomes you everytime, as do Bobbie, Razz's wife and Razz himself.  Yummy!

VThis replica of a Parisian bistro serves up bistro classics such as the flatiron steak, cassoulet with duck confit, and delicious pommes frites. It's a great place to sit outside at the patio cafe.  Excellent wine list with many reasonably priced French wines.
p109
aVReally good food.  The designers actually succeeded making this look like an old Parisian bistro.  Once you are inside you can almost forget that you are in Scottsdale... at a mall.  Can't go wrong with a burger and fries here.
p110
aVAverage food on a very limited menu.  Service was barely adequate, and the prices were very over-priced.  Location is convenient, but parking can be an issue.  Seems to be very popular with the trendy high school crowd [something I shied away from even when I was in high school]...
p111
aVLunch here is delicious and well worth it.  Dinner?  Spend your hard-earned money elsewhere.  If it's easy-earned money and you don't care to spend then by all means enjoy the authentic atmosphere and above average French food... just don't order the flat iron steak.

aVI love ZInc Bistro's enviornment. Its beautiful. I HATE the Service. And most of the food is meh. Be advised if you go in for just some espresso's with friends you will get  treated poorly by your server. They aren't very cheap either. I usually avoid going there mainly because I feel like punching the servers square in the face there.

Sorry, but until the restaurant improves quality across the board, and attitude drops - I am unable to recommend this restaurant at this time.

aVI love to go into Zinc in the afternoon and sit at the bar. The staff is very friendly and attractive :) The food is pretty good too but its  a limited menu.

aVWe stopped in here for lunch when we first moved out here, and at first I was "wowed" - the interior courtyard has an excellent ambiance. It's very romantic, quaint and pretty. The positive experience ended there, however. We waited quite some time for our waiter to even acknowledge that we were sitting there. When he finally did, it seemed as though he was bothered by us more than anything else. We ordered oysters, which was a big mistake (it was like $16 for dime sized oysters - ridiculous). Clearly this restaurant does not know what a real oyster looks like or they would not have insulted two people from Louisiana like that! Our main course was okay, but again, overpriced. I had a chicken salad, and I couldn't even eat it as a proper sandwich. My husband had a burger and was not overly enthused. The fries were tasty, though! Overall I got the sense that this place was trying to cater to ritzy "ladies that lunch" but fell short. The food was too prissy for lunch time, and it was too expensive. The food wasn't even really that good as a matter of fact. We might try this place again at dinner, but not for a while.
p118
aVIve found the food to be very good here and the service to be above average. What I do see are alot of ridiculous people eating there. Just fo your info, it's annoying when someone sits at a table in a restaurant and only orders espresso. That table is for people who want to EAT and that table is where the waiter earns a living. It's not a park bench. I've found that waiters are generally only rude to rude people. Treat them and their space with a little respect.  I think this is an above average restaurant with nice wine prices, good (and sometimes great!) food, and good service.
p119
aVI went to Kierland Mall in hopes to dine at Ocean Club, only to find a 1 hour 50 minute wait, next stop North, who had a 45 minute wait. By chance I walked over to Zinc where I was seated immediately! I should have know there was a reason and I found out very soon.\u000a\u000aAlthough the place was half empty, the manager insisted our party of 2 sit at a tiny table that was soon over- crowded with just a bread basket and a bottle of wine. Where were they going to put the food?\u000aWell after they spilled a glass of wine on the both of us while trying to set down our appetizer, I got up and moved us to one of the larger empty tables. The bus staff (who was excellent) help us gracefully make the move. The manager (Ben)  however, still tried to hassle us even though the place was now even emptier than when we first arrived. In spite of all this, our barely-existent waiter took our order after I had to send for him twice. He was not helpful at all in explaining any dishes, and could not make any recommendations when asked for suggestions. He was very bothered by the whole process and seemed more interested in talking to his manager between ever course. I continually had to keep asking for him to keep the dinier moving. When the check came, I caught two mistakes, he over-charged us for a bottle of wine I didn't order and added an appetizer that was supposed to be for someone elses bill. The prices are high enough, there is no need to pad the bill, but double-check it for sure.\u000a\u000a The food was outstanding! The best short ribs I've ever eaten and I order it everywhere I can. Too bad the dining experience ruined the night. Obviously, the word must be out. High prices, very dim lights (always makes me suspicious about what they are trying to hide) and horrible service explains why there is always a table available. Do yourself a favor, wait the hour elsewhere, it will be better than ruining your night.

aVThis reminds me nothing of the cafes I ate at while in Paris. Sadly, however, I wasn't in France, but Texas. Yes, Paris, Texas. My car broke down. I believe I had a cowboy omelet and a large ice tea while waiting for the repair. Here, at Zinc Bistro, I pretend I'm Paris, France. A glass of Burgundy with the French onion soup and some pomme frittes and I say WEE WEE! I've had good service here. Although I've seen larger tables having issues with flagging servers down. It's like they can't rememeber to ask for everything at once and the servers is doing some serious wind sprints from the kitchen to the table. The manager is way cool and always remembers me. I do love the bistro style atmosphere here and love hearing other peoples conversations when I dine a lone. I know. Shameful. But one couple was actually signing their divorce papers over a steak and a bottle of champagne.

aVOk\u000aI lived in France \u000aI adore French food\u000a\u000aAfter reading reviews, I went to Zinc Bistro hoping to love it.\u000a\u000aAnd I did\u000a\u000aBlame it on the bellini and kir royale if you wish, but I thought this restaurant was top notch in all ways.\u000a\u000aOur server was awesome, and very attentive.  Even though some people at my table didn't speak English very well, he was warm and accomodating.\u000a\u000aThe drinks were awesome, and I thought for the quality of champagne in my bellini and kir royale, very well priced\u000a\u000aThe inside of the restaurant was reminiscent of many brasserie's in France\u000a\u000aThe food was amazing.\u000a\u000aWe had a 5 cheese platter, and the waiter presented me with a listing of ten cheeses and let me pick out five.  I could only pick four, so left the 5th cheese up to him.\u000a\u000aThe cheeses were very French, and the two that were my favorite were the Brillat Savarin and the Epousse :)\u000a\u000aFor dinner I had the moules frites, and a side of the mac and cheese.\u000a\u000aBoth were AWESOME\u000aThe moules frites were served in a white wine sauce and the mussels themselves were very large and tasted fresh as can be\u000a\u000aThe mac and cheese.  MMMM.  There were slices of ham inside, which was unexpected, but delicious.  \u000a\u000aMy boyfriend, he got a filet with foie gras seared on top, all served on a plate with a wine reduction sauce.\u000aI tried this.\u000aAnd OMG\u000aI wished I had gotten it.\u000a\u000aThe foie gras along with the filet, was AMAZING.  Like, I'll dream about it for awhile.  I'll go back for this dish alone.  Again, I thought the $36 price tag for this dish was very reasonable.  The filet was top notch, and the foie gras\u000a\u000aOh the foie gras\u000a\u000aHow I love foie gras....\u000a\u000aSo yeah.  \u000aI really, really, really dug this place.

aVZinc Bistro is a must  if you visit Kirland Common, this restaurant is no stranger to awards and recognition. \u000aWhy I love it,\u000aFour and a half Stars, So close to Five.  I worked at Trio in Chicago and really enjoyed learning about French fine dinning.  Notice how many tables are served and how much detail is given to service and especially to each dish.  Most Fine dinning French restaurants are very small but Zink takes on an enormous challenge to satisfy each customer.  I really like the flat iorn steak and the wine selection is sure to please those who enjoy French wines.  I tend to order the Chateauneuf Du Pape.\u000a\u000aDessert,\u000aIf you like chocolate order the Souffle and make sure you order it 1/2 before your ready.

aVEvery time I am in Scottsdale I make my friends go with me to Zinc Bistro it is my tradition and one of my favorite French restaurants I have been to. Here are some observations....\u000a\u000a* super cute ambiance definitely urban Paris compared to rustic countryside.\u000a* Location is great in Kierland for shopping before or after\u000a* Amazing menu and the most amazing Lemon Souffle I have ever had in my life. I pretty much dream about it and wake up drooling.\u000a* For all of you saying its "snobby" wake up, really though? You are in SCOTTSDALE everything is snobby so just take it in and ignore the snobbery and enjoy the ambiance and food. \u000a*yes it may be slow but why do we have to be fast? \u000a\u000aI can't wait to go back its a top fav for me.
p124
aVI like the foo-foo French cuisine every once in awhile, but Zinc is fabulous b/c its every day French and not overly priced for the quality and creativity. \u000a\u000aBon Appetite!
p125
aVWhen I lived in Scottsdale I loved dining here.  It can be pricey put the food is worth every penny.  Best Souffle and french pressed coffee I have ever had.  The entrees are small but rich in flavor where you savor every bite.  Definitely a must if visiting Scottsdale.  You will never guess you are in the middle of the desert if you're sitting out in the quaint patio with the romantic lighting in the evenings.  It will transport you to Paris France with the ambiance, service and of course the food!

VI looooove this place. It's a good thing I only work in our Phoenix office on Fridays because otherwise I would go broke. Au Petit is the most adorable little French cafe. The dessert case will make you salivate - the desserts are all perfect little pieces of art just tempting you to cheat on your diet.\u000a\u000aI usually get the tomato basil soup, and it's delicious. The sandwiches are quite tasty, too. The location is really convenient for all of the office buildings right in the Biltmore area, but I don't know if I would come here unless I was at work (just because the location is strange). However, if you're ever shopping at the Biltmore mall, do yourself a favor and walk over to Au Petit. The wine list is very good, and there is also outdoor seating for pretty days. The people that work there are very friendly, and the ingredients are extremely fresh. It's not the most economical lunch place, but it's worth every cent on Fridays when I indulge.
p131
aVSo far (after two visits) I love it here.  Armed with a menu, I called down to place a "to go" order.  You can't begin to imagine my delight when the guy answered the phone in a French accent so thick it was hard to understand.  I placed my order for the "half sandwich and side" deal (extremely reasonable at $5.60) and ran down to get it.  I ordered the mozzarella sandwich minus the prosciutto, and the pasta salad for the side.  Regular readers may know that in my opinion, nothing beats a good mozzarella sandwich, so I was absolutely thrilled to find that it was delicious.  Nice crunchy baguette, fresh mozzarella, and flavorful tomatoes.  The pasta salad was also very good... very simple, just cold pasta with some olive oil and seasonings.  I'm not a super adventurous eater, so while I loved the pasta salad I would guess that others might find it a tad boring.\u000a\u000aToday I had the tomato basil ravioli soup, which was very good except that it was a little skimpy on the raviolis.  Flavor was delicious, though.  It comes with a few toasted slices of baguette.  Personally, next time I'll just order a fresh baguette to go along with it.\u000a\u000aThe entrees and full sandwiches are a little more pricey, but I'm a light eater, so the half sandwich/side deal is an absolute steal for me.  There's not a sandwich on the menu that doesn't sound mouth watering, and the desserts.... oh my god I wanted one of each.  Add in the extremely friendly service (who said Frenchmen were rude??) and I'm happy to say i've found my new lunch spot.\u000a\u000aEdited to add:  As far as I can tell, they're open in the evenings too, so next time yo find yourself seeing a movie at the Esplanade, stop by Au Petit Four (right by the escalators) for some yum.
p132
aVA rare authentic gem in Phoenix. This is the best french bakery / bistro in the Valley. The owner is from Lyon and has been here with his family for 10 years or so. His french pastry chef is extraordinary. Very unique find - imported directly from France as well. He's probably 80 and has prefected so many of his recipes. All of the pastries here are truly awesome.\u000a\u000aI haven't eaten here for lunch. But, the after dinner or before movie treats here are very good.
p133
aVAnother place I've been visiting for years and forgot to review. Everyone else has said a ton about the food. The pastries are, indeed, great. I can indulge my weakness for almond croissant. Nice option for a peaceful lunch. \u000a\u000aOK -- here's why I really love this place. A few years ago, the owner put up some paintings by a friend of his from Lyon. There was an about-the-artist sign on the wall. All it said was "He paint just during the night." \u000a\u000aMinus one star for the Malthusian disaster that is the Esplanade parking garage.
p134
aVThis was a delightful find as I wandered from the Ritz Carlton in search of a quick lunch.  The owner parle francais, as il vient de Lyon, and even when he speaks English he mixes in French words.  Having grown up around French-speakers, I found this comforting and home-like.\u000a\u000aI got the zucchini soup and loved it.  Had cream in it, but not too much for a low-fat item-seeker.  It came with a delicious baguette.  While I've never been to France, I've heard rumors of how flavorful the bread is and this bread seems to match the descriptions I've heard.\u000a\u000aTheir menu offers several options for those who are calorie/fat conscious.  Several salads and healthy soups.  The "house" salad has salmon with lemon and olive oil on mixed greens, not the average house salad in the US, and makes for a refreshing change of pace.   The menu also includes several dishes with duck.\u000a\u000aSitting on a table near the cashier are several magazines to flip through, mostly french.  So, I entertained myself during my meal by reading through a french recipe magazine.  Marveilleux!
p135
aVLove, love, love the goat cheese and leeks quiche and salad combo (love the mini-baguette, as well).  If you like hazelnut, you MUST try the hazelnut royale.  Totally decadent!!  The croissants are magnifique!  I like the chocolate and the almondine the best.\u000a\u000aI really must return soon to sample more of the lunch fare.
p136
aVThis is another lunch option in my building. It is, though, decidedly hit or miss. I usually stick with the quiches or something from the bakery, all of which have been good, esp. the croissants. They also have great coffee and espresso drinks and serve the little bottles of fizzy french lemonade that make you feel less like you are at work. \u000a\u000aStill, there are some drawbacks. My frequent dining companion usually gets a sandwich, and, according to him, they have ranged from passable to inedible.
p137
aVLove this place, SO quaint and lovely. \u000aThe owners are incredibly sweet which makes it impossible for me to be mad at them for making their food so damn expensive. Seriously, $8.20 for a baguette slapped with butter (mind you, deLICious butter), ham and a small side salad?! Zut alors.\u000aYet I keep coming back like a battered wife. Maybe it's the way the owner exclaims "Bon Appetit!" as he's serving your meal. And he means it. It's adorable.
p138
aVA friend of mine and I have been going here for lunch for a while. Our tradition would include escaping from school/work on Mondays and meeting up here for lunch. The coffee is good, the pastries are great, and the food is excellent. They used to have this iced tea there (but seemed to have swapped it for something else as of late) that was unbelievable. We called it the "Tea of Freedom." It tasted like a promising adventure awaiting you just around the corner. Stop laughing! It was really damn good iced tea. But just as it came into my life, it was gone just as elusively.\u000a\u000aThe owners are accommodating and charming. On slow days we would see him sitting outside with a demitasse of espresso and reading French newspaper, only to hop to his feet when we walked in. \u000a\u000aIt does appear the prices have gone up, and they're approaching steepness for a cafe, but this is the Biltmore after all. \u000a\u000aHighlight: Don't know what to get? Ask for a recommendation. You won't be sorry.
p139
aVNot the best croissant I've had and the almondine was a bit tough.  The owners are very pleasant in that European way and make you feel welcome.  I'll have to try them for a Euro sandwich sometime since I seem to like them better than I liked their pastry.  Sometimes its not just about the food, and this is one of those places, so I am hoping for a reason to return frequently.
p140
aV**Update: Catherine, one of the owners, sent me a very sweet message thanking me for the business and wishing me a happy holiday. You can't put a price on such good nature!
p141
aVConveniently located on the way in to the movie theater, my mom and I popped in here for a snack to smuggle in to the movie. Nothing makes my mom happier than a good bakery, but actually nothing here looked great to me. Perhaps it was the time of day?  I think we stopped in at about 7pm.\u000a\u000aI settled on a big chocolate chip cookie that was WAY too sweet.  Like, inedible.  \u000a\u000aMy mom loved her danish thing that she ate the next morning, though.  And service was very friendly.
p142
aVWho knew a chocolate croissant could be so hard to find!   I'll always love Au Petit Four because they helped solve my craving - one that I had for three months.\u000a\u000aActually, my husband and I have been back many times - just for desert - and enjoyed every visit.  We met the owner (I think), who happily shared   tips of where to visit outside of Paris. (If they guy wasn't the owner, I don't care because he was charming, French, and made us feel special.)\u000a\u000aI want to go back and try an actual meal. But with certainty - it will always be a favorite spot for desert.
p143
aVStopped by to check on what's on display.  Decided on the apple turnover ($3.95) and my favorite Au Petit Four item, the hazelnut royale ($6).  Was surprised at the new cost- I recalled it being around $4.50 last time I visited, but  Catherine informed me that the price increased $1 only.  If only I wasn't so enamored by the hazelnut wafer crust...  \u000a\u000aMy fave pastry did not disappoint; If only I could say the same about the turnover :(    I'd just tried a HUGE apple turnover ($3.95) offered at The Farm Kitchen @ the Farm at South Mountain the day before that had cubed apples in the filling, so I was expecting cubed apples in this French pastry, especially at the price I paid, but alas, it was filled with applesauce.  The flaky pastry was satisfyingly crispy, I'll credit APF that.  But applesauce??  You've been warned.\u000a\u000a(Uploaded some photos.  Hope you enjoy!)\u000a\u000aUPDATE:  Catherine emailed to inform me that they fill their turnovers with "superpomme," a French import made with real apples w/o preservatives nor added sugar.
p144
aVThis place gets 4 stars just for existing. I was in Phoenix for work, trekking around for lunch near my hotel. I went down a narrow unmarked alley that happened to have a string of shops wedged in between two soul-less office buildings. And there is this authentic french bistro, staffed with friendly french folks serving up excellent food. I had the hamburger lunch special. Very good, although even better if they would spring for slightly more lean meat (a bit greezy). Went back the next morning for breakfast, very good eggs.
p145
aVOne thing about Phoenix is that it's near impossible to find French food, and good French food at that. Well, look no further than Au Petit Four. I'm French, so I've got to admit that I've got a bias for eating at a French place that serves real French food by French people. The owner is really cool and makes sure that everything is tip-top while you're eating. To be honest, everything is pretty pricey but it's totally worth it and I don't think that there's such a thing as cheap French food anyway.\u000a\u000aBe sure to check out the quiche lorraine and to try one of the eclairs. The only thing that is painfully missing from this place is having a stock of Orangina in the fridge, but c'est la vie, non?
p146
aVI stopped by for a ham and cheese croissant two weeks ago, and I can't recall the last time I felt so ripped off.  I actually wanted to get my hazelnut royale fix, but balked at the price tag- $6 a piece!  After a few minutes, the male owner talked me into trying the croissant.  After he heated it up in the microwave, he charged me $8, plus tax, which I felt was too much, esp. for a croissant that is almost a day old.  I wished it was more crispy, but since it was microwaved, the bottom was very soggy, and only the very top layers were slightly crispy.  After a few bites, I perused through tthe take-out menu and couldn't find the croissant under the dinner menu; Instead, I found it under the breakfast menu- $5.95 with white sauce, and $6.55 with scrambled eggs.  So I was charged $8 for a plain ham and cheese croissant that was a breakfast leftover??  \u000a\u000aI left very disappointed with my dinner selection that day, and with ever-increasing prices, I won't be coming back soon, if ever.
p147
aVBonjour ooo la la yummeee, If you like fresh made from scratch daily french pastries this is where the magic happens! Oh they also Cater!\u000a\u000aI have been coming here since they first opened Catherine and her husband Pierre are Tre' sweet! They always have a tasty variety and they are very good at making suggestions that will satisfy whatever it is you have a taste for. \u000a\u000aExcusez-moi Aileen B, It is a fresh croissant house made throughout the day and it's with black forrest ham and imported cheese, at the Esplanade you got off cheap for 8.00. Starbucks has a tiny turkey and swiss for 6 bucks and it's not on homemade anything. \u000a\u000aI eat here at least once a week, love the baguettes. They also make olive bread which is Divine! Katharine makes the best scrambled eggs! I also love the salmon sanwich (yes that's french for sandwich lol) on a baguette. \u000a\u000aMy grandparents came to visit from Illinois. I brought them here for lunch. 1st because I love it and 2nd my grandfather is from Lens, France. He loved everything he had and said the baguette reminded him of his mothers. He also enjoyed speaking a little french with Pierre and Catherine. He is a little rusty in the french department. \u000a\u000aAu Petit Four makes me proud to be 1/4th french. Au revoir, Bon appétit!

VA weekend in PHX. I love to stay at the Biltmore, which is still full of really nice employees, despite reviews I've read on different boards.\u000a\u000aI went to the fashion park before Jack could join me the next day. I looked at the menus of Sam's, Christopher's, and Steamers, and decided on Steamers  for lunch. I was very happy but wanted some wine and cheese post lunch.\u000a\u000aSo Christopher's was perfect. Now why only 3 stars? Well, maybe I should give 4. But: first, the ambiance/lighting was very off. It was an overcast day in PHX. But in Steamers it was still great. At Christopher's it was dingy with poor lighting. Secondly, whereas the bartender was very nice when present, she was seemingly too busy with other customers even at outside tables. And the place was NOT busy. \u000a\u000aThe wine selection is excellent. The cheese selection is also excellent though I would have liked a little better recommendations.
p153
aVThere are certain things that I am particularly sensitive to and the first is lead by my nose. I have one hell of a sniffer and as I have admitted in prior discussions in this open forum, my nose can be a nuisance. Today as we were out celebrating the holiday at the Biltmore Fashion Park and looking for a light bite, maybe even a glass of wine or bubbles, we decided to stop upstairs to Christopher's. It has been several months since my last visit and recently - in one of last week's discussions - I strongly encouraged a fellow SF yelp-er to visit Christopher's. I thought it would be wise to revisit a place I have genuinely enjoyed. \u000a\u000aNow, before I continue, I agree, Christopher's can have, what I refer to as, disconnected service. And, when I am on the receiving end and being disconnected, I force a connection - especially if I want to engage conversation and have questions answered from the service team. That being said, we walked in, asked to sit at the bar and for menus and a wine list.\u000a\u000aThey were going to disconnect us. Yeah, not going to happen. We were in a chatty mood and we wanted, very badly to have one glass of champagne and to be full of cheer. I ordered two glasses of Tattinger Rose Special Cuvee and as I sat for my friend to return from the restroom, I couldn't get past the smell. I know that smell. I used to work at an older Tempe bar and I know the smell of well - I know the smell. And, I also know the lovely perfume that should be enjoyed with this champagne, that wasn't happening either because I was distracted. As my friend returned and sat down, she said "Does it smell funky in here." Thank goodness, she smells it too. Its not just my obnoxious sniffer. I opted that we move outside.\u000a\u000aAt this point, I let the bartender know why we were moving. I am of the thought that you should responsibly let the service team or management know when something really displeases you or distracts you from a moment. Restaurants, lounges and bars are in the business not of just food and wine, but of making memories. And a memory shouldn't stink.\u000a\u000aSo, I casually said something to the bartender know and we moved outside. And, although we disconnect ourselves with the odor, our service stayed connected. We enjoyed our glass of champagne and moved on and through our shopping extravaganza. \u000a\u000aI hope that our fellow SF Yelper didn't receive any funky odor and that it was a stale rarity. And for now, I'll give Christopher three stars.
p154
aVThis is not a gourmet restaurant, but it has a gourmet menu.  The cuts were tough and just weren't prepared well.  The steak was very inconsistent, as if it were not tenderized properly.  The pasta's were just boring.  The more I think about the place, the more upset I get because it was such a let down.  I thought going in, this would be Phoenix's salvation.  It did not rise above the rest, but slipped into mediocrity along with the rest of the Valley's overpriced fare.
p155
aVI have a long love-hate, divorced, remarried, divorced relationship with Christopher's. Perhaps it is my overall disgust with the French offerings of late and their seeming laziness of effort in technique, but Christopher's just doesn't cut it anymore.\u000a\u000aPaola was always too aggressive on her wine list. Impressive to look at, but a disappointment to order from... sorry, don't have that... sorry, don't have that either. It was always something you just had to get used to, mildly expressing your disappointment and frustration with your server; they'll never get it.\u000a\u000aRecently, they've been able to get a super discount on salt. They use it liberally on everything. My last two visits have been such. I have such respect for Christopher and his team, the first time I just grinned and bore it. But this last time, I did send my main course back. What happened to the godly veal reduction? It tastes manufactured... does Shamrock even do a veal stock? I shudder to think. (I flee any building with marks of Shamrock foods.)\u000a\u000aMy favorites have been the pastry of snails (escargot), the filet of beef, the mushroom soup, the onion soup, the sautee d'fois gras, the pear salad, and of course the cheese plate. Oh, I almost forgot, the decadent osso bucco and accompanying pile of pasta.\u000a\u000aI miss the days when Christopher served a set of 10 tables on the other side of 24th street. Sure, the CD of Chopin Nocturnes played the same track over and over, but the fois gras was to die for and the Bordeaux I had my heart set on was immediately available.\u000a\u000aWhat is happening to fine dining in this town? Where else can I go? Please. PLEASE! Tell me.
p156
aVChristopher's is one of those places that would get 4-5 stars outta me except for the spotty service! I typically order from the specials menu b/c for some reason it always seems more appealing and creative than the regular menu. \u000a\u000aHere's a funny...the bread they serve is prepped on a massive wood carving counter centered near dining tables. The last time i was there, my server takes our order, walks to to the counter to get our bread, then fusses with and smooths her ponytail at the carving table. She then starts cutting our bread!!! The only reason I noticed every move is b/c we were seated very near the bread table and I wondered if she was gonna wash her hands btwn her ponytail and the bread. Not! Even if this incident never occurred, I'd still say the service is spotty. Sad but true. \u000a\u000aBon Appetite!
p157
aVThank God Christopher's has moved to a new location at The Biltmore shopping mall between Saks and Macy's. WOW, what a beautiful space! I felt like I was in New York City! There is an attached lounge called Crush that is relaxing but also a nice place for a pre/post dinner drink. I found the staff to be very attentive and the food to be fantastic. Try the roasted bell pepper soup and the hanger steak. The french fries are to die for! We were able to watch the kitchen staff working in the open kitchen which was also fun.

VI'm a foodie. Spoiled rotten by years in NYC. I've been to Sophie's several times. If this review were based on my first visit, it would have been 5 stars. The pate starter is better-than-sex good and we decided that with the wine we chose, we could have just made a meal of it. It was just as good on return visits. The duck breast entree, is also a winner. Perfectly cooked and seasoned, served with a leek fondue that made me want to lick the plate [my mother raised me better]. The cassolet was redolent and rich. In a word: delightful. I dropped a star because during my last lunch there I had a turkey dish and it was clear it was old and leftover. Not a happy camper. I'm hoping it was a fluke because the rest of my experiences have been very positive. I've had great servers, have never been rushed, overall great.
p163
aVWe had a very nice overall experience at Sophie's.  My husband and I are very critical when it comes to semi-fine dining and we were pleasantly surprised.\u000a\u000aIt is a very quaint, cozy restaurant in a very strange area.  We started with Escargot and French Onion soup. The Escargot were very tasty and traditional. The French Onion soup probably should have been a bit more traditional. It was a tad sweet and could have used a bit more brothy richness. We opted for wine by the glass. Whatever white wine I first ordered was not drinkable and they quickly whisked it away and replaced it with another wine of my choosing with heavy apologies.\u000a\u000aFor our entrees, I had the scallops which were beautifully cooked, nice sauce and delish ricotta gnocchi. My husband had the duck and it was also superb and  very well cooked. \u000a\u000aDessert was a bit of a disappointment. We were debating between our old standby of creme brulee and lime mousse calypso. We opted away from the safe option and went with the lime calypso. It tasted as if it had been refrigerated for a while. The lime mousse wasn't limey enough and the bread bottom was a distraction and not so tasty.\u000a\u000aThe service was impeccable. We really liked our waitress and a man who we believe was the owner stopped by at each course to see how everything was. Nice touch.  \u000a\u000aOur only other criticism was the bread service.  It was warm which is a plus in my book but not that tasty. I think it could be easily improved. It was the right idea in that it was a warm crusty baguette but not that tasty.\u000a\u000aOverall, we would definitely go back there. Would we crave it? Probably not but if you are looking for a solidly very good dining experience I would send you here. It was very comfortable and cozy.
p164
aVI've been driving past Sophie's for 3 years now and finally took the opportunity to go for happy hour. On Friday night they have half price bar appetizers and my husband and I split 3 dishes and were blown away!\u000a\u000aWe ordered the escargot, which was very tender and delicious and had a very authentic, rich flavour. The smoked salmon was perfect with the creme fresh sauce and toasted baguettes on the side. \u000a\u000aThe most amazing dish we sampled was the Noisettes de boeuf, which is essentially small tender pieces of beef wrapped in very lean bacon in a Dijon mustard sauce. This was seriously the most amazing beef that I've ever had and I'm typically not a steak person. We ended up ordering a second helping of it since it was really that good!\u000a\u000aWe finished off the night with a delectable Creme Brulee and it brought me back to my days living in France. It was the perfect ending to an incredible meal.\u000a\u000aThe owner of the restaurant is extremely friendly and sat down at the bar to chat with us for a while. The bistro has a very warm and inviting atmosphere and the patio is beautiful at night. This place isn't snobby like a lot of French restaurants and the staff is very responsive.\u000a\u000aWe ended up spending about $100 between the drinks and 4 appetizers (BTW - the Mango Martini is to die for!) but the whole experience was really worth it. \u000a\u000aTuesday night is ladies night with half-price wine by the glass and I'll be back again soon for that.\u000a\u000akeywords: french food 85016, french cuisine, biltmore area french bistro, arcadia area french food
p165
aVAmazing!  From start to finish this place was incredible.  Great french host (Mgr?).   Great french waiter, helpful and funny.   The support staff was way above average always, plates cleared and drinks filled in a timely manner. \u000a\u000aI REALLY like the fact they don't rush you and try to flip tables, we were there about two hours. \u000a\u000aThis is a quaint little stand alone restaurant that also has a small bar and a few tables out on the patio.  I'll be back soon just to visit these areas.   \u000a\u000aWe started with a nice bottle of french wine.\u000a\u000aFor the appetizer:\u000a\u000aBrie en Croute\u000aCreamy Brie coated with toasted almond slivers and\u000awrapped in puff pastry, then baked, served with toasted\u000abaguettes and port reduction \u000a\u000aThe main courses:\u000a\u000aPoitrine de Porc Provencale\u000aPan roasted pork tenderloin crusted with herbs d'provence\u000aand served with sweet corn and goat cheese polenta fritters,\u000asauteed pea tendrils with grape tomatoes and leek fondue\u000a\u000aAnd...\u000a\u000aCoquille Saint-Jacques a la Sophie\u000aPan seared Sea Scallops served over sauteed ricotta gnocchi\u000awith a citrus and shaved fennel baby arugula salad\u000afinished with tarragon beurre blanc\u000a\u000aFor Desert:\u000a\u000aRaspberry Brulee\u000aChambord soaked fresh raspberry\u000ainfused in vanilla creme brulee\u000a\u000a----- I need to get creative and come up with more birthday's, anniversary's, holidays, or some other random reason to splurge on a place like this more often.
p166
aVI'm always a bit wary of foreign foods -- I like what I like, and it takes something for me to branch out and try something new. French food is on the list of things that I am more than willing to consume, and so I was very excited to try Sophie's while visiting in Phoenix/Scottsdale.\u000a\u000aThe restaurant is in what appears to be a converted house, and so it's small, intimate and quiet (even with tables placed very close together). The host is very attentive and seated us promptly, with menus and compliments to boot. The menu is quite simple but straightforward, with the entrees titled in French but clear, English explanations below (for those who may not understand the language). The wait staff is very cordial and unobtrustive, unlike the busboy who typically made a show of clearing the table when you were done with a plate (-1 star for that).\u000a\u000aThe food was excellent and well done, exactly to specifications -- upon ordering the prime rib, as I did, I was asked if I wanted end pieces or the center cut (something which I'd never been given the options for). The dessert was also excellent, with wonderful Illy espresso and coffee to finish.
p167
aVI've eaten lunch at Sophie's several times and have always been impressed.  What this restaurant does with an omelet should be patented.  That said, my  experience with dinner is not so favorable.  My wife and I recently joined friends for Sophie's prix fix dinner with wine parings.  The meal started with fried sweetbreads.  Frankly, sweetbreads are generally too delicate for frying and this was certainly the case with our meals.  Chewing and tasting of frying oil, they were the worst sweetbreads I've eaten.  To top it off, they paired the dish with a cloyingly sweet rose that tasted more like Two-Buck Chuck than a serious wine pairing.  The meal did not improve any with its scallop or short rib courses, both of which were paired with equally unctuous wines.  The coup de gras was the gelato dessert, reminiscent of cheap raspberry sherbet.  Sophie's can do better.  For almost $80pp, they darn well better start soon.

aVI don't really have to much to say about Sophie's.  The food wasn't bad, the service wasn't horrible... it's just that my overall experience wasn't what I'd have expected from a restaurant that touts such an amazing reputation for fine French cuisine.  It's not often I leave a place so hungry for the experience I didn't get to have.  . Again, the food was not bad, but I'm not sure If I will ever be back.

aVThis is easily the BEST RESTAURANT i have ever been to\u000a\u000aI love french food, and this is the very best I have ever had. Amazing service (the owner is such a nice guy), amazing service and the atmosphere is cozy and romantic (perfect for a date).\u000a\u000aI agree with some of the other raters-- this place would get 10 stars if yelp would let me put 10. Try the duck and the beef bourguignon!
p170
aVYeah croque madame on WHEAT BREAD, that took 45 minutes to come out, at least I Love Genie, was on the TV.
p171
aVThe actual restaurant is fine, the service is friendly and good.\u000a\u000aI am not going to go in to the food other than to say, no.\u000a\u000aOh well $340 bucks and all I can muster is a no.
p172
aVSophie's in one word?  Perfect.\u000a\u000aI only go twice a year to celebrate the end of the fall and spring semesters.  Why?  Because I don't want it too become familiar or stale.  Yes, it's expensive, but you get what you pay for and Sophie's doesn't disappoint.\u000a\u000aDining is an experience.  You put on shined shoes and a tie and make reservations.  I like to go around 5:30 because it's usually not that busy.  The dining room is inviting, calming, welcoming.  You can have a conversation without having to raise your voice.  \u000a\u000aI always make it a point to try something way out of my comfort zone:\u000aLobster Bisque -- the last thing I eat before I die!\u000a sweet breads (a.ka. brains) -- ethereal...\u000agooey, runny cheese -- salty and tangy\u000apate (goose liver) -- creamy and so flavorful\u000a\u000aThings I wouldnt' have eaten in a million years are some of the best things I have EVER eaten.  Sophie's just invites you to be daring.\u000a\u000aDo you wait for your food?  Yes!  But that is the best part.  You can have a conversation with your date, you can relax.  They don't make you feel rushed so why should you take on the responsibility yourself?  Just enjoy yourself.  The food is coming.\u000a\u000aSo many places are so desperate to turn over tables that diners adopt the same mentality.  Gotta get my food fast, gotta eat it fast, gotta get out of here!  \u000a\u000aI love Sophie's because I can take the time to appreciate everything.  It is just so wonderful to find a place like that to look forward to every year.  It's worth the wait.
p173
aVI've always been a fan of Sophie's A French Bistro and why not!?! This is just a great French bistro serving classic dishes on clean white table clothes. \u000a\u000aSerge is the consummate host and makes all feel welcome whether dining at the bar or in the dining room. \u000a\u000aHot rolls and real butter, always appreciated. Micro green salad in a French vinaigrette, very nice. French onion soup, bubbling cheese - yum. Garlic laced escargot (would 2 orders be too much?). \u000a\u000aThe steak with fries - what is not to like? \u000a\u000aTry it too for special events, such as the French crepe dinner... \u000a\u000aDesserts are lovely, too. \u000a\u000aSophie's is also a great business lunch restaurant conveniently located between downtown Phoenix and the Biltmore-Camelback corridor.
p174
aVDottsy Z. and I met here last week to try their new happy hour and we had an amazing time! The weather was perfect, the patio beautiful, and the company was amazing.\u000a\u000aTheir happy hour menu featured a nice variety of white and red wines, all for $6, plus we tried the escargot, pate, and frites as well. We spoke to chef, who was very knowledgeable and able to accommodate gluten free items, especially if you call a day or two in advance. \u000a\u000aWe topped off the night with a decadent creme brulee and imported cocoa dusted truffles, which capped off the evening on a perfect note.
p175
aVFrench food--yummy!  Had the duck confit cassoulet.  It was great.  The duck was melt in your mouth tender, the beans and sauce delicious. It was a very affordable $24.00 which included a small salad.  I would ask one thing--get a few less expensive bottles of red on the wine menu.
p176
aVI've always loved French cuisine and thanks to Sophie's I have found another great French restaurant. The restaurant has a cool background/story is fairly acclaimed in Phoenix but doesn't boast it when you're there.  The waiter we had was French and has the quintessential French accent, which always adds to the experience.\u000a\u000aThe FOOD: We went for Mother's [to be :)] Day brunch. $49 a head, which was a bit steep for the overall selection of food. But the items on the menu were great. Pork loin, a chicken piccata sort of dish, smoked trout, some pate, salmon and a ton of fresh fruit.  Omelets were made to order and mimosas and bloody's were great. There was also a variety of nice breads and cheeses. \u000a\u000aCan't wait to go here for dinner sometime. Wine list please.
p177
aVI had never heard of Sophie's Bistro before I went last night, but can now say that I am a big fan.\u000a\u000aIt was very quiet when we arrived, but I suppose 8:30 pm on a Wednesday night is late for many Valley diners. The owner greeted us right away and was very friendly, and happy to find out that my date was French. I liked how simply decorated and cozy the restaurant was, and felt more like I was dining in someone's home in Paris rather than at a restaurant in the middle of the desert, with French pop tunes wafting in the background. \u000a\u000aI ordered the Magret de Canard, and it was absolutely delicious. The duck was cooked perfectly, and the skin had a lovely crisp texture. It came with a rick leek fondue and savory potato boulangere that paired nicely with the duck. My date had the filet mignon dressed with brandied green peppercorn cream, which was melt-in-your-mouth tender. We chose the 2007 Jaboulet red wine that was light, and went well with our meals. We ended with a cocoa-dusted creme brulee that was huge, and quite tasty but a little on the sweet side. \u000a\u000aOverall, I thought the place was lovely and will definitely go back, perhaps in the fall to enjoy the patio.
p178
aV4.5 stars\u000a\u000aI had my first date with Jessica F here! It was supposed to be a big group (yeah you FLAKES) but it ended up being just her and I and we were treated like ROYALTY!\u000a\u000aLet me get some disclosure out of the way: Thomas was our server, and he is also a friend of mine. That being said, he was professional and courteous. He definitely had his "Top Notch Waiter" hat on that night. You probably wouldn't have been able to tell we are friends.\u000a\u000aWe indulged in some of the wine specials for their happy hour. Each glass I had was only $6. We decided to try the escargot (nice and garlicky), the pate (delicious) and the frites (they were frites). \u000a\u000aThe main event of the night for me was the Beef Bourguignon. Omigosh, friends! I dream of this dish to this very moment. The beef was perfectly cooked and the burgundy sauce was FANTASTIC. WHEW! Did it just get warm in here? I was so full and happy after that amazing meal!\u000a\u000aI will most certainly return to Sophie's in the hopes of giving them the 5 stars I'm sure they deserve!
p179
aVThe owner Serge was very French, but his head chef was not. I loved that their head chef came from another culture. He had fallen in love with French food. So much so, he had moved to France to study it there. The dishes he created were perfectly delicous. I remember his filet with crushed peppercorns; it was soft and buttery. The peppercorns gave a kick without being overpowering. The quail was delicate and succulent. The salad with lavender honey vinaigrette was perfection. His chocolate spice cake was phenomenal. It contained seven spices. I can't begin to describe the joy that cake brought to everyone. It was unique. It was at the time when chocolate souffles were at every French restaurant. Unfortunately, he's not there anymore. Regardless, my rating will remain until I have a chance to go back and say otherwise.

VWonderful fine dining experience with an old school feel.  Best wine list EVER!  While the food was delicious, it was somewhat uninspired.  I enjoyed the experience more than the food.
p185
aVWhile the food remains very good at Vincent's, over the last several years the service has deteriorated significantly.   Stay away on any night when they have a lot of guests if you want your wine glasses refilled, bread refilled, or your main course to show up in a reasonable amount of time.   We used to go to Vincents for various family celebrations but now have crossed it off our list even though the maitre d'hotel did give us free champagne with dessert the last time after we complained about the service.  Try Michael's at the Citadel instead, T Cook's or Mary Elaines (although the latter is considerably more expensive and formal).
p186
aVVincent's is THE BEST restaurant in Phoenix--hands down.  You could move this restaurant to Manhattan, Las Vegas, San Fran, etc. and it would still be in the upper echelon.  However, in Phoenix it really rises above the pack.\u000a\u000aThis place has food, wine, opulence, service, and atmosphere to deserve this rating.  Very old school type of place with a wine list that took me a few visits to really understand how awesome it is.  Want a 1969 Margaux or a 1982 Chateauneuf?  They have it.  Champagne Rose vintage 1988?  Check.  I ordered a more recent bottle, but it was properly opened, decanted, and my glass was always 1/3 to 1/2 full.\u000a\u000aI really enjoyed the classic French menu.  My choice of pate, goat cheese salad, and wild boar was just delicious beyond belief.  Perfectly cooked, awesome presentation, and the timing of the courses was impeccable.\u000a\u000aThey have a Southwest-inspired menu as well, and it looked great...
p187
aVHands down one of the best in Phoenix. Great food and wine.  Service is usually flawless. There is nothing not to like so bring out of towners or someone you care about and they will love you for it!
p188
aVI was surprised here for my birthday and it is a very romantic, old-school, traditional great service kind of place. The low lighting and small dining rooms make for a great ambiance. \u000a\u000aThe dual menus, one french-ish and one southwestern-ish are sort of on odd pair, but it is Scottsdale. The appetizer, shrimp "beinets" were simply breaded, fried and very greasy while the lavender dipping sauce and salad that came along with were much more appealing. Both our entrees were wonderful and perfectly cooked - so well in fact, the sides were essentially meaningless, even though I remember them as fairly good also. So if you find yourself here, keep the Ahi Tuna and the Wild Boar in mind.  The wine menu is extensive and filled with surprises. \u000a\u000aThe wait staff were classic in service, yet easily engaged in conversation and very friendly. They only acted snobby for the people who expected it, we on the other hand provided the Diamondbacks/Rockies scores and had a great time! We ended the night with great Grand Marnier birthday souffles. \u000a\u000aGreat place, people and food - we would go back.
p189
aVOutstanding memories of this place...Valentines Day 1999...Absolutely first class service, highly polished cooking, but very conscious of its Southwestern surroundings, this place still stacks up against the best. If you can deal with amusing and effete clientele (bombed-out Barry Goldwater Republicans) then Vincent's well worth the expense.
p190
aVJust had a wonderful experience here.  Came with a group of 6 people from work.  \u000a\u000aEveryone was extremely friendly and helpful. Loved the fact that the waiter also had a good sense of humor. Always helps when you're at a really nice place and don't quite fit in with all of the bling-bling that goes on at the other tables. Saw THE biggest ring on this woman's finger. I swear her hand must have hurt... although she's probably used to the weight by now...\u000a\u000aAnyway, back to the food... Ordered the Lobster & Tomato salad with olive oil and lime dressing. I highly recommend it.!! The lobster was delicious and the tomatoes very yummy. I'm kind of a tomato fanatic so  I'm rather picky when it comes to that. Besides the amazing taste, the presentation of all of their food gets another star. The tomatoes and lobster was assembled so it looked like a lobster  - the included the shelled out tail, claws, and head to complete the picture.  The dressing was also very light and the greens very fresh.\u000a\u000aFor my main course I ordered the fish special which tonight was the Char. I'm usually not a big fish person but it was very light and very tasty. It came on top of a risotto with carrots, beets, and string beans on the side. It was in a creamy but light sauce. \u000a\u000aNow let me tell you about dessert... This place seems like Souffle central. We ordered three different kinds of souffles. But what was awesome is that they went ahead and split it up for us so we can share it easily. Thought this was very considerate and, quite frankly, super cool :)\u000a\u000aWe got the Lemon one that came out looking like a crepe. Imagine super fluffy and light! Made from egg whites, this is probably THE fluffiest dessert I've ever had. We got the Grand Marnier one which was good but not my favorite. Now, if you like your desserts sweet, go for the Raspberry one. It was my favorite :) Very fruity but still light and not too sweet. \u000a\u000aAnd as if we didn't have enough desserts, they also gave each one of us our own flourless chocolate cakes which was really delicious. I was initially going to give it 4 stars but what was really awesome is that when the valet guy pulled up the car, I saw that they had put two little bag of cookies in the front console. How awesome is that!? Haven't had any of them yet, but they sure smell good :)\u000a\u000aOverall great place :)
p191
aVThis has to be my absolute favorite for special occasions and all other occasions for that matter. \u000aThe wait staff is prompt and professional. The food, from beginning to end is overwhelmingly delicious. I love it; the breads, salads, soups, main courses, desserts, wine, drinks. It is all so good. \u000aI can't wait to go back, hopefully soon.\u000aA couple of years ago, we saw Senator McCain with his wife and 2 other couples there at dinner. Wonder if we will see a blog from him for Vincent's on yelp.com....hmm?
p192
aVFood's good, but I've always considered Vincent's over-rated & over-priced.\u000a\u000aThere are too many excellent restaurants for me to consider it.  If I want that kinda deal, I'll go to Christo's.
p193
aVLong time favorite of my family's.  Go there for all special occasions.  The croissants.... oh the croissants.....\u000a\u000aEverything is delicious, but I LOVE the black bean soup.  Before I became a vegetarian I always used to get the grilled rack of lamb...  My brother loves egg in a hole.....the corn ravioli is to die for.  Basically, you can't go wrong.  And Vincent, the chef- is a gem.
p194
aVI recently came back with an invitation from Vincent.  It was heaven.  The service was impeccable, wine suggestion appropriate and the food was beyond words to describe.  I am leaving my previous review below so you can see the difference and improvement.  Everything about this visit was warm and inviting.  I wholly recommend you visit if you get the chance. I know that I will definitly want to try their bisto (connected to the restaurant) as well on my next trip down.\u000a\u000a\u000aAnother time that I'm sad to give only three stars for a favorite place.  I came back for a visit to AZ after 10 years and this is the place I wanted to see.  I definitly talked it up to my friend and we went on one of my last nights there.\u000aThe food is so seriously yummy that it takes a couple of seperate menus. The tap water that they served my friend while we waited for our table was horrible.  They did not offer the water that they serve you during dinner.  So ask for the bottled if you go there and have to wait.  You get two servers and they are not always the most coordinated but they get the job done.  I could have done without the server that kept coming to the bar while we were waiting and kept complaining about everything.  The bartender was excellent and will treat you well.\u000aDo not go here if you are on a diet or are eating clean.  Go here if you want food cooked in the traditional pound of butter with cream sauces and five courses. Yummy.

aVI knew it was going to be a good wedding party when I saw the Vincent's Van Go parked outside my cousin's house. I didn't know anything about Vincent's, having never heard of it, but the cleverness of a Vincent's Van Go and the cute little van tickled my funny bone. \u000a\u000aThe meal consisted of salads and gourmet pizzas being passed around by wait staff. At first we were confused - no real meal? it turned out that the tray-passed pizzas and buffet salads were plentiful enough so that no one would go hungry. \u000a\u000athey weren't just standard pizzas - BBQ chicken, ratatouille, margherita, sun dried tomato and avocado, and pepperoni. quite a variation, right? they were good! very good. one of the vincent's people said that they made oer 100 pizzas for the evening, fresh right from their catering van. tasty! \u000a\u000alikewise, the salads were wonderful. the Cesar salad was right up among the best I've ever had - wonderful delicate flavors, nothing was overpowering but all of the garlic, anchovy, Parmesan could be tasted. nicely balanced, fresh lettuce, wonderful croutons in good proportion to the rest of the salad (don't you hate it when the lettuce-to-crout ratio is off?) \u000a\u000ait was a very nice meal. very satisfying, very enjoyable. I'd like to visit the actual restaurant to try some other menu items. next time!
p196
aVI really enjoy having Sunday Brunches here.  The outdoor seating is nice when the weather is right; they have set up some canopies so everyone sitting outside can really enjoy the warm weather.  The service is great and everyone is friendly.  The food is full of flavor and the portions are perfect; when you sit down you are served croissants and jam before ordering you meal.  When you think it is done your server brings out dessert for your table; it is always great, making the meal and experiance complete and satisfying.
p197
aVI'm stuffed!  No please, no more food!  Wait, it's free?  You just want to give me extra food because you feel like it?  Alright, I guess I could sacrifice and eat this delicious chocolate cake and free cookies you put in my valeted car!\u000aI swear that is how it is every time I dine at Vincent's.  They love providing extra treats which is why this place exceeds five stars.  The food alone is divine!  I love every item on their menu!  The souffles are to die for as well.  But they always seem to go above and beyond every meal.  If only every restaurant had the same level of customer service!
p198
aVWhat a great place. Another instant top 5 favorite. Loved the food, the staff is wonderful, the whole establishment is quite nice. It is located in a pretty silly place but I love it. The ratatoullie is amazing and don't even get me started on the duck confit. Hands down one of the best meals I have ever had. So good.
p199
aVWhile I didn't get the authentic Vincent Southwestern French experience (they offer a limited menu in summer...the waiter explained that their regular menu is too wintery and heavy for the summer season), I am still glad I finally made it to this Valley fine dining establishment. We opted for their special "Julia & Julia" $35 3-course prix fixe menu, a great value at a restaurant where entrees alone typically run $35. All but one of the dishes were Julia Child recipes, while the one that wasn't was a dish Chef Vincent cooked for Julia Child many years ago. The dishes were very classic French fare, and all were exceptional. And their croissants...oh my! I could've eaten 10 of them! The service at Vincent's is professional and friendly, if not always the most prompt, while the dining room is Old World elegant (think French Cottage dishes and a player piano). If you've never tried Vincent's or haven't been in a while, I highly recommend taking advantage of this great deal while you can (this August only!).
p200
aVWe went for restaurant week and had outstanding service, wonderful food, and reasonbale drink prices.  We really enjoyed beef tenderloin, smoked salmon quesadillas, and pecan pie.  My French Maritini with Grey Goose was awesome for $12.50!  It is a formal setting with low lighting for a nice romantic setting.
p201
aVWe came here on a Saturday during Restaurant Week.\u000a\u000aThe service was excellent and very professional.  We received our orders quickly and everything was prepared exactly how we ordered it.\u000a\u000aI ordered the salad with goat cheese and pears.  It was good.  Not great, but I ate the whole thing so I definitely can't complain!  The goat cheese was delicious and creamy.\u000a\u000aFor my entree, I ordered the beef tenderloin.  It was also delicious!  It came with a small portion of scalloped potatoes, a few green beans, and a few asparagus.  For me it was a perfect portion size, but for anyone else I think it may have been a bit small.  But since it's on the special "Restaurant Week" menu, I'm sure the portions are meant to be smaller.\u000a\u000aFor dessert, I ordered the creme brulee.  It was delicious as well!  The waiter also brought out a chocolate cake/lava cake?  Not sure what it was but it was yummy and served with an ice cream that was very light.  Almost seemed like whipped cream, but it was definitely ice cream.\u000a\u000aOHHH!!  I almost forgot about the bread!  I loved, loved, loved it!  The butter is the best!  I couldn't quite figure out what is in the butter.  It almost tastes like a cream cheese.  It was wonderful!\u000a\u000aOverall, everything was good but I don't know if I'd ever rush back.  I have other places I like more, but this was a good restaurant.  I would definitely recommend it to others!
